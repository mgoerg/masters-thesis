Title: Algebraic Models for Loop Spaces and Configuration Spaces
---------------------------------------------------------

Abstract: String topology is the study algebraic structures on the homology of the free loop space and related spaces. We exhibit two constructions of the loop product and coproduct on a simply connected manifold $M$ that allow us to prove that the cohomology of the free loop space has the structure of a co-Batalin-Vilkovisky-algebra. The first construction uses the Fulton-MacPherson compactification of the configuration space of $n$ ordered points, which is a convenient context for the construction of the intersection product on $M$. The second construction is purely algebraic and shows that the intersection map in the definition of the loop product is algebraically a lift of the intersection product on $M$. Starting with a differential graded algebra model $A$ of $M$, we generalize the Hochschild chain complex construction to construct explicit cochain complexes which model mapping spaces from graphs into $M$, such as the path space and the figure eight space of $M$. Our main tool is a theorem known as the pullback-pushout lemma, which shows how one can compute the cohomology of a pullback of spaces using the derived tensor product.
