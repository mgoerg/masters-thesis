\section{Configuration Spaces}

\paragraph{Definition} For $X$ a topological space resp.\ a set, let
\begin{align*}
    \Conf_X(n) = \{(x_1,\dots, x_n)\in X^n \mid x_i \neq x_j\ \text{if}\ i\neq j\}
\end{align*}
We write $\Conf_m(n) \coloneqq \Conf_{\R^m(n)}$. Note for a natural number $n$, we write $\underline n \defeq \{1, \dots, n\}$; thus we can write $\Conf_{\underline m}(n)$, which is a finite set and not a space. 

\paragraph{Homotopy Properties} The configuration spaces are homotopy equivalent to the little disks operad. For an overview of properties of the little disks operad see~\cite{fresse2017homotopy}. There is a recognition principle by Fiedorowicz, which gives sufficient conditions for an operad to be homotopy equivalent to the little 2-disks operad. There is no higher-dimensional analogue, because the recognition principle relies on the universal covering. 

\paragraph{Fadell-Neuwirth Tower} There is a tower of fibrations $\Conf_m(n) \to \Conf_m(n-1) \to \dots \to \Conf_m(2) \simeq S^{m-1}$, which split (e.g. by adding a point at infinity or duplicating the $i$th point). The fiber sequence is $\bigvee_{n-1} S^{m-1} \to \Conf_m(n) \to \Conf_m(n-1)$. Check Lem 3.4 in~\cite{sinha2010homology}. 

\subsection{Homology and Cohomology} 
See the notes of the cacti operads talk for more detail on this, 

It is well-known that $H^*(\Conf_m(n))$ is the free graded commutative algebra generated by $\alpha_{ij}$ with degree $1$ modulo the relations $\alpha_{ij} = \pm\alpha_{ji}$, $\alpha_{ii}=0$ and $\alpha_{ij}\alpha_{jk} + \alpha_{jk}\alpha_{ki} + \alpha_{ki}\alpha_{ij} = 0$. The generators are given by $\pi_{ij}^*\omega$ for $\omega\in C^{m-1}(\Conf_m(2))$ representing a fundamental cohomology class, (note the homotopy equivalence $\Conf_m(2)\simeq S^{m-1}$). This is a classical result by Arnol'd, proven via spectral sequences, through analysis of the fibration maps $\Conf_m(n) \to \Conf_m(n-1)$. 

In homology, it is known that $H_*(\Conf_m(n))$ is the Gerstenhaber operad for $m=2$ and an analog for $m>2$. Explicitly, this is the universal operad generated by $\mu\in H_0(\Conf_m(2))$ and $b\in H_{m-1}(2)$, where $\mu$ is commutative and associative, $b$ is anticommutative and satisfies the Jacobi identity, and both are related via the Poisson identity. 

\paragraph{Duality}
Let $\Delta_m^{(r)} \defeq \{x\in M^r \mid \exists i\neq j \ \text{s.t.}\ x_i = x_j\} = M^r\setminus \Conf_M(r)$. By Poincar√©-Lefschetz duality, there is an isomorphism 
\begin{align*}
    H_*(\Conf_M(r)) \iso H_c^{mr- *}(M^r, \Delta^{(r)}_M)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Fulton-MacPherson Compactification of Configuration Spaces}

Following~\cite{sinha2004manifold}, with slightly different notation.

For $(i,j)\in \Conf_{\underline n}(2)$, let $\pi_{ij}\colon \Conf_{\R^m}(n)\to S^{m-1}$ be the map which sends $(x_i)_{i\in\underline m}$ to the unit vector in the direction $x_i-x_j$. For $(i,j,k)\in\Conf_{\underline n}(3)$, let $s_{ijk}\colon C_{\R^m}(n) \to (0, \infty), s_{ijk}(x) = \abs{x_i-x_j} / \abs{x_i-x_k}$.

For a compact manifold $M$, fix an embedding $M \hookrightarrow \R^m$.

\paragraph{Definition} Define the ambient space of the Fulton-MacPherson compactification $A_M(n) = M^{\underline n} \times (S^{m-1})^{\Conf_{\underline n}(2)} \times [0, \infty]^{\Conf_{\underline n}(3)}$. Let 
\begin{align*}
    &\alpha_{M,n} \colon \Conf_M(n) \to A_M(n)\\
    &\alpha_{M,n} = \iota \times \left(\pi_{ij}\right)_{ij} \times \left(s_{ijk}\right)_{ijk}
\end{align*}
Additionally we consider the case $M=\R^m$, where we make a similar definition, but omitting the first factor, i.e. $\alpha_{m,n} \colon \Conf_{\R^m}(n) \to A_{\R^m}(n), \alpha_{m,n} = \left(\pi_{ij}\right) \times \left((s_{ijk})\right)$
The \emph{Fulton-MacPherson-Axelrod-Singer} compactification of the configuration space is the closure of the image of the above map: $\cConf_M(n) = cl_{A_M(n)}(im(\alpha_{M,n}))$ resp.\ $\cConf_m(n) = cl_{A_m(n)}(im(\alpha_{m,n}))$. 

\paragraph{Notation} The maps $\iota, \pi_{ij}, s_{ijk}$ can be extended to the closure $\cConf_M(n)$ by first defining them as maps from $A_M(n)$ as projections to the relevant factor and restricting to $\cConf_M(n)$. 



\paragraph{Properties} In~\cite{sinha2004manifold} it is shown that if $M$ is a compact manifold, then $\cConf_M(n))$ is a compact manifold with corners, whose top stratum is homeomorphic to $\Conf_M(n)$. In particular, the compactification is homotopy equivalent to the configuration space. 


\paragraph{The $\R^m$ case} For $M = \R^m$ we omit the factor $\iota$ in the definition of $\alpha$, because in this case an additional compactification needs to happen, not only at the diagonal but also at infinity in $\R^m$. Note that one can restore the original configuration of points from the image of $\alpha_{m,n}$ up to translation and scaling in $\R^m$. Translation corresponds to choosing one point, scaling corresponds to choosing the distance to one other point, then everything is uniquely determined. Usually it is enough to consider the $\pi_{ij}$, but in the case that points are collinear, $s_{ijk}$ identifies their position relative to each other. For a real vector space $V$, denote by $ST(V)$ the group generated by translations and scaling with a positive scalar in $V$, this acts naturally on $V^n$ and the configuration spaces. Note that $ST$ is contractible, so we would get the same homotopy type using either of the definitions. The compactification factors as $\Conf_m(n) \to \Conf_m(n) / ST(\R^m) \to \cConf_m(n)$, where the first map is part of a homotopy equivalence and the second map is a homeomorphism onto its image, with dense and open image. 


\paragraph{Stratification via trees} To understand the additional points in the compactification, we first consider the case where two factors of a configuration converge towards the diagonal. Consider a point $x\in \cConf_M(n)$ with $\iota_1(x) = \iota_2(x)$, $\pi_{1k}(x) = \pi_{2k}(x)$ and $s_{k12}(x) = 1$ for all $k$. We interpret this as a configuration of $n$ points $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ where two points $x_1, x_2$ appear to be identical from the lens of $\iota$ and $\pi_{1,k}$, $\pi_{2,k}$, however $\pi_{12}(x)$ is still a well-defined value, which gives the two points a well-defined position relative to each other, i.e.\ a well-defined element in $(T_{p}M)^2/ST(T_{p}M)$ for $p$ representing the position of $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $M$. If all other points have distinct images in $M$, these positions are described by a stratum homeomorphic to $(T_{p}M)^2/ST(T_{p}M) \times M^{n-1}$. More generally, we may have multiple points which appear at the same position ``from outside'', but have a well-defined position relative to each other inside the tangent space. The same phenomenon can occur inside the tangent spaces as well, and even iteratively.

    \caption{A point in $\Conf_M(6)$ associated to a tree with four internal nodes. }
\end{figure}    

\begin{definition}
    An $f$-tree is a rooted connected tree with labelled leaves and no bivalent internal vertices. The root is allowed to be bivalent (and also univalent).
    
    By defining a relation via edge contraction, one obtains a poset structure on the set of $f$-trees with $k$ leaves, denote this by $\Phi_k$.
\end{definition}
See figure~\ref{sinha-trees} for an example.

    \end{subfigure} 
    \caption{Example of $f$-trees. }\label{sinha-trees}
\end{figure}


\begin{theorem}
    There is a stratification on $\cConf_M(n)$ where each stratum $\cConf_M(T)$ corresponds to an $f$-tree $T$ and the poset of the stratification is $\Phi_n$. Similarly, for $\cConf_m(n)$, there is a stratification where each stratum $\cConf_m(T)$ corresponds to an $f$-tree $T$ where the root has degree at least $2$. 
\end{theorem}


\paragraph{Operad Structure on $\cConf_m(n)$} In the $M=\R^m$ case one may equip $\cConf_m(n)$ with an operad structure using the stratification explained earlier. 
\begin{theorem}
    The operad $\cConf_m$ is equivalent to the little $2$-disks operad $\mathcal D$.
\end{theorem}

To see this, we define a structure of an ``operad up to homotopy'' on $\Conf_n(m)$ (this is not standard terminology), in the sense that the associativity of composition does not hold on the nose, but there are canonical homotopies. There is then a zig-zag $\cConf_m \leftarrow \Conf_m \to \mathcal D_m$, where the first map preserves the operadic composition operations and is a homotopy equivalence on each level. The second map preserves the operadic composition operations up to homotopy and is also a homotopy equivalence on each level. This is enough to show that the homological operad structures agree, for an actual homotopy equivalence, one uses the Boardman-Vogt construction, which is a cofibrant resolution of topological operads.

To describe the operad structure ``up to homotopy'' on $\Conf_m$ in more detail, define a map $\Conf_m(n) \to \mathcal D_m(n)$ by drawing an outer disk around the barycenter of the configuration and drawing small disks around each point in the configuration (the radii should depend continuously on the configuration). Using this map and the projection to the center map $\mathcal D_m(n) \to \Conf_m(n)$, one may transfer the composition operations of $\mathcal D_m(n)$ to $\Conf_m(n)$. If multiple compositions in $\Conf_m$ are performed, the disks may differ in size, which leads to different configurations, but there is a homotopy comes from rescaling the circles. 

For the $m=2$ case one can alternatively apply a recognition principle by Fiedorowicz: The symmetric group acts freely on $\Conf_n(\R^2)$ and the quotient $\Conf_n(\R^2) / S_n = \UConf_n(\R^2)$ has $\pi_1(\UConf_n(\R^2)) = B_n$, the braid group of $n$ braids. The universal cover of $\Conf_n(\R^2)$ is contractible and has a braid operad structure with free action. Any two such operads with contractible total space and free group action are equivalent. Quotienting the equivalence by $PB_n = \ker(B_n \to S_n)$ we obtain an equivalence of the original operads. Then show that this also holds for $\cConf_n(\R^2)$.


\paragraph{Operadic module structure of $\Conf_M$} We build a fiberwise version of the configuration spaces $\cConf^M(n) = Fr_M\times_{SO(n)} \cConf_m(n)$, where $Fr_M$ is the oriented orthonormal frame bundle of some (irrelevant) metric on $M$. This is an operad in spaces over $M$. Then $\cConf_M$ is an operadic right module over $\cConf^M$. If $M$ is framed, then $\cConf_M$ is a module over the $\cConf(\R^D)$ operad.






\subsection{Graph Complex of Configuration Spaces}

\subsubsection[The euclidean case]{The case $M=\R^m$}

\paragraph{Homology} We first exhibit a homological complex construction; this is ad-hoc, not following any reference. Recall from earlier that the homology is given as an operad generated by a multiplication $\mu$ and a bracket operation $b$. To a rooted binary tree with labeled vertices one can assign an element of $H_*(\Conf_m(n))$ by putting $b$ at each of the inner vertices. To a collection of such rooted trees (a forest), one can assign an element of $H_*(\Conf_m(n))$ by multiplying the previous elements up. These elements generate the homology as a module. 

We now create an operad of chain complexes related to rooted trees $\mathcal{RT}$, by using the same generators $\mu$ and $b=b_2$ as before, but we add generators $b_k\in\mathcal{RT}(k)$, which corresponds to a corolla with $k$ incoming vertices. Compositions of the generators $b_k$ can be graphically depicted as rooted trees, now no longer binary. $\mu$ is still commutative and associative. I haven't figured out how the Poisson relation translates to the higher terms, thus the operad structure is somewhat unclear for forest-like elements. The differential is given by the dual of edge contraction modulo some symmetries, so that the differential of $b_3$ is the Jacobi element of $b_2$. There is an exact sequence $H_{k(m-1)-1}(\Conf_m(k), \partial\Conf_m(k)) \to H_{k(m-1)-2}(\partial\Conf_m(k)) \to H_{k(m-1)-2}(\Conf_m(k))$. The generator $b_k$ represents the fundamental class of $H_{k(m-1)-1}(\Conf_m(k), \partial\Conf_m(k))$.

\paragraph{Cohomology} We now outline the complex descibing the cohomology of $\Conf_m(n)$. For a detailed construction, see \cite[Chapter 6]{lambrechts2014formality}. Consider diagrams (graphs) $\Gamma$ with $n$ labeled ``exterior'' points and an arbitrary finite number of indistinguishable ``interior'' points. Define a graded vector space freely generated by these graphs, where the degree of a graph is 
\begin{align*}
    \deg \Gamma = \abs{E_\Gamma} \cdot (m-1) - \abs{I_\Gamma} \cdot m.
\end{align*} 
We omit some details here: to choose appropriate signs in the differential later, one has to induce orders on most of the data of the graphs and talk about loops, parallel edges etc. The differential is given by edge contraction for edges with at least one internal vertex. Admissible diagrams contain no loops, no double edges, no internal vertices of valence $\leq 2$ and each internal vertex is connected to some external vertex. 

The admissible diagrams form a graph complex $\coGraphs_m$ with differential given by edge contraction. They form a Hopf cooperad with multiplication given by union of graphs, identifying the external vertices by their labels, and cooperadic cocomposition is dual to the operad with operadic composition $\comp_i$ which inserts at the node $i$ a graph and sums over all choices of connecting the loose edges to $i$. 

\begin{theorem}
    The complex of admissible diagrams is quasi-isomorphic to the singular cochain complex of $\cConf$.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Graph Complex according to Idrissy \cite{idrissi2021real}} Assume $M$ is a simply connected compact manifold and $A$ a Poincar√© duality model of $M$. The Lambrechts-Stanley model of $\Conf_m(r)$ is the chain complex 
\begin{align*}
    G_A(r) \defeq A^{r\otimes} \otimes S(\omega_{ij})_{1 \leq i\neq j\leq r} / I.
\end{align*}
where $I$ is generated by 
\begin{itemize}
    \item the relations $\omega_{ij}^2, \omega_{ji} = (-1)^m \omega_{ij}$, $\omega_{ij}\omega_{jk} + \omega_{jk}\omega_{ki} + \omega_{ki}\omega_{ij} = 0$ that appear in the presentation of the cohomology by Arnol'd.
    \item $p_i^*(a)\omega_{ij} = p_j^*\omega_{ij}$ for an $a\in A$ and $1\leq i\neq j \leq r$. 
\end{itemize}

Here, $p_{ij} \colon A\otimes A \to A^{\otimes r}$ is $p_{ij}^*(a\otimes b) = p_i^*(a)\cdot p_j^*(b)$ where $p_i^*\colon A\to A^{\otimes r}$
\begin{align*}
    p_i^*(a) \defeq 1\otimes \cdots \otimes 1\otimes a\otimes\cdots\otimes 1
\end{align*}
with the $a$ in the $i$-th position. 

The differential $d = d_A + d_{split}$ on $G_A(r)$ is the sum of the differential induced by that on $A$ and replacing an edge by the diagonal class of $A$
\begin{align*}
    d_{split}(\omega_{ij}) = p_{ij}^*(\Delta_A).
\end{align*}



\paragraph{Intuition} The following is not meant to be precisely true, but it still gives good intuition. Let $\Gamma$ be an admissible diagram with $\ell$ interior vertices and fix an order on the interior vertices. Consider the intersection $\bigcap \pi_{ij}^{-1}(c_{ij})\subset \cConf_m(n+l)$, where $c_{ij}$ are constants. This is a space with expected codimension $\abs{(E_\Gamma)}\cdot (m-1)$, we interpret it as a homology class in $H_*(\cConf_m(n+\ell), \partial\cConf_m(n+\ell))$. Map this along the projection $p_{n,\ell}\colon \cConf_m(n+\ell)/\partial\cConf_m(n+\ell) \to \cConf_m(n)/\partial\cConf_m(n)$ which forgets the last $\ell$ points, denote the resulting class by $a_\Gamma\in H_*(\cConf_m(n), \partial\cConf_m(n))$, now of expected codimension $\abs{(E_\Gamma)}\cdot (m-1) - \ell\cdot m$. The boundary of the space is given by edge contraction of $\Gamma$. Under Poincare duality, it corresponds to the form $\bigwedge \alpha_{ij}$ of degree $\abs{E_\Gamma}\cdot (m-1)$. 

For example, figure \ref{graph-complex-ex} shows how the Arnol'd identity $\alpha_{12}\alpha_{23} + \alpha_{23}\alpha_{31} + \alpha_{31}\alpha_{12} = 0$ in cohomology arises in this way: Interpret the diagram in (b) as the space of configurations of four points where the relative directions between the interior and the exterior point are fixed. The codimension one boundary of this is given by the configurations where the interior point is infinitesimally close to one of the three exterior points (and the relative directions are still fixed). Forgetting the interior point now yields three components as in (a).  

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.65\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{img/graph-complex-jacobi-2}
        \caption{The Arnol'd identity $\alpha_{12}\alpha_{23} + \alpha_{23}\alpha_{31} + \alpha_{31}\alpha_{12} = 0$}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{img/graph-complex-jacobi-1}
        \caption{A cochain whose boundary is the Arnol'd identity}
    \end{subfigure} 
    \caption{Arnol'd identity in the graph complex. }\label{graph-complex-ex}
\end{figure}

This intuition the definition of the boundary operator and the product structure. The operad structure is not immediately clear. 

Note that the projection $\cConf_m(n+\ell) \to \cConf_m(n)$ becomes an umkehr map in cohomology due to Poincare duality. Thus one can use fiber integration to represent this. The construction ``configuration space integral'' quasi-isomorphism $Graphs_m \to \Omega_{PA}(\cConf_m)$ essentially works as described above. The construction of the umkehr map is difficult, as the fiber is not a manifold, hence one uses PA forms here. 

\subsubsection{The manifold case}

Following \cite{campos2016model}. 

%\paragraph{Decorated Graphs} Let $H$ be a vector space and $S$ be a collection of graphs with vertex sets $V_G$ for $G\in S$. The vector space of decorated graphs is the space

%\begin{align*}
%    \bigoplus {G\in S} \Lambda(H_v \mid v\in V_G)
%\end{align*}

%where $\Lambda$ is the commutative algebra generated freely by the vector spaces and the $H_v$ are distinct copies of $H$ for each vertex $v$. Thus each vertex may be decorated with multiple elements of $H$ at each vertex, which are related tensorially. 

% \paragraph{Pre-dual graphs} Let $V$ be an $N$-dimensional graded vector space with a non-degenerate pairing of degree $-D$; $\langle\blank,\blank,\rangle\colon V\otimes V \to \R$ s.t. $\langle x, y\rangle = (-1)^{kl+d}\langle y, x\rangle$. The example to keep in mind is the cohomology of a connected $N$-manifold. We may require that the pairing is compatible with the multiplication or a differential. 

% Let $e_1, \dots, e_N$ be a basis of $V$. Denote by $\coGra_V(n)$ the free graded commutative algebra generated by symbols $s^{ij}$ of degree $D-1$ for $i,j \leq n$ and $e_1^j\dots e_N^j, j=1,\dots,n$, quotiented by $e^j_1 - 1$. Define a differential via 
% \begin{align*}
%     &de^j_\alpha = 0 \\
%     &ds^{ij} = \sum_{\alpha, \beta} g^{\alpha\beta}e^i_\alpha e^j_\beta
% \end{align*}
% where $g^{kl}$ is the inverse of the matrix describing the pairing on $V$ (so $\sum_{g^{\alpha, \beta}} e_\alpha e_\beta$ is the ``diagonal class'' i.e.\ the associated copairing). More abstractly, one can also present this without choosing a basis in $V$, by considering the graded commutative algebra generated by $n$ different copies of $V$ and the free symbols $s^{ij}$. A homogeneous element corresponds to a graph with $n$ vertices and decorations at each vertex with elements of $V$, see figure \ref{cw-graph-example}. 

If $M$ is a compact orientable manifold, denote by $\coGra_M(n) = \coGra_{H^*(M)}(n)$. If $M = \R^D$ and hence $V=k$ concentrated in degree $0$, then the above construction, omitting differentials, yields a graded vector space, which we denote $\coGra_D(n)$; this corresponds to undecorated differentials. 

$\coGra_D$ is a cooperad and $\coGra_M$ is a comodule of $\coGra_D$. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/campos-willacher-graph-dual-example.png}
    \caption{An example of a graph describing an element in $\coGra_V(4)$}\label{cw-graph-example}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The dual graph complex $\coGraphs_M(n)$} As a vector space, it is spanned by $n$ labeled external vertices and an arbitrary finite number of internal vertices, decorated by (possibly multiple) cohomology classes of deg $\geq 1$, under the condition that there are no connected components without external vertices. There is a graded commutative algebra structure given by superposition of external vertices (i.e. disjoint union of graphs followed by identifying the external vertices with the same label). The differential splits as $\delta_{contr} + \delta_{cut} = \delta_{contr} + \Delta^* + \delta_{Z_M}$, where $\delta_{contr}$ contracts edges with at least one internal vertex and $\delta_{cut}$ splits edges with the copairing. This may produce ``forbidden'' graphs containing connected components without external vertices. This is the $\delta_{Z_M}$ part, which maps these components to a scalar via the function $Z_M$.

There is a similar construction for the $M=\R^D$ case for $\coGraphs_D(n)$, the difference is that all internal vertices of graphs are required to be at least trivalent (and no decorations are required). This has a cooperad structure which is induced by the dual of contracting a subgraph: for the coaction on a graph $\Gamma$ one sums over tuples $\Gamma', \Gamma_1, \dots, \Gamma_k)$ such that when each graph $\Gamma_i$ is inserted at the vertex $i$ of $\Gamma'$, one can reconnect the loose edges such that one obtains $\Gamma$.  

TODO: Image

\begin{theorem}
There is a quasi-isomorphism between $\coGraphs_D$ and $\Omega_{PA}(\cConf_D)$ (which is equivalent to $\mathcal A_{PL}(\cConf_D)$), which is compatible with the cooperad structures (in an appropriate sense).

There is an equivalence between $\coGraphs_M$ and $\mathcal A_{PL}(\cConf_M)$ which is compatible with the cooperadic comodule structure.

\section{String Topology Operations via Configuration Spaces}

In this section we construct the string product and coproduct in the form that they will be used later. We use a slightly unusual construction using configuration spaces instead of the usual construction using Pontrjagin-Thom collapse maps. We begin with the construction of the intersection product on a closed manifold $M$ using configuration spaces. We then give an analogous construction of the string product and coproduct. 

Let $M$ be a closed oriented manifold. Recall $\cConf_M(2)$ is the compactified ordered configuration space of two points in $M$. This is a stratified manifold with a substratum diffeomorphic to the unit sphere bundle $UTM\subset TM$. The square
\begin{equation}\label{M_pushout}
\begin{tikzcd}
    UTM \dar\rar & \cConf_M(2)\dar \\
    M \rar["\Delta"] & M\times M
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
is a homotopy pushout since it is a pushout of topological spaces and map $UTM \to \cConf_M(2)$ is a cofibration. Thus the homotopy cofibers of the  vertical maps are homotopy equivalent due to the pasting law for homotopy pushouts %TODO reference
and they are in fact versions of the Thom space $DM / UTM$ (where $DM$ is the unit disk bundle). This is the main ingredient to the construction of the intersection product. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma_pullback_cube}
    Let $E\to M\times M$ be a fibration and $E|_M, E|_{UTM}, E|_{\cConf_M(2)}$ the pullbacks of $E\to M\times M$ along the maps in diagram \ref{M_pushout}. Then

    \begin{equation} \label{E_pushout}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        E|_{UTM} \dar\rar & E|_{\cConf_M(2)}\dar \\
        E|_{M} \rar["\Delta"] & E
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}
    
    is a homotopy pushout. In particular the cofibers are equivalent.    
\end{lemma}
This follows from Mather's cube theorem, where diagram~\ref{M_pushout} is the bottom face of the cube, diagram~\ref{E_pushout} is the top face, and the side faces are pullbacks by construction. %TODO reference here


\subsection[Intersection Map via Configuration Spaces]{Intersection Map in $M$ via Configuration Spaces}\label{subsec:intersection-in-M-via-conf}

We want to construct the intersection product map $H_*(M) \otimes H_*(M) \to H_{*-n}(M)$. In cohomology, this corresponds to a map $H^*(M) \otimes H^*(M) \from H^{*-n}(M)$. For a review of the intersection product, see section \ref{sec:intersection_product}.

Using the observations from above, we can construct the intersection coproduct as the sequence of maps
\begin{equation}
\begin{tikzcd}
    H^*(M\times M) & \lar H^*(M\times M, \cConf_M(2)) \dar["\iso"] & \ \\
    & H^*(M, UTM)& \lar["\cupp Th"] H^{*-n}(M)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
The cohomologies in the middle of the diagram are the cohomologies of the mapping cone, hence of the homotopy cofiber. The vertical map is the isomorphism from above. The last arrow is the Thom isomorphism, i.e.\ multiplication with the Thom class, which is a cohomology class of the Thom space which represents the orientation of $M$. % TODO: Reference for Thom Iso

\begin{theorem}
    The above map is identical to the intersection product defined via Poincar√© Duality in section \ref{sec:intersection_product}. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We show this for the homological version of the intersection product, the cohomological statement is analogous. The homological version of the above construction is
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            H_*(M\times M) \rar & H_*(M\times M, \cConf_M(2)) &  \\
            & \uar["\iso"] H_*(M, UTM) \rar["\capp Th"]&  H_{*-n}(M)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}
    In the proof of theorem \ref{thm:intersection_product_tubular} it is shown that the intersection product is equal to the sequence 
    \begin{align*}
        H_*(M\times M)\xrightarrow{\capp u_\Delta} H_{*-n}(M\times M) \xrightarrow{\pi_{1*}} H_{*-n}(M)
    \end{align*}
    The first map is the cap product with $u_\Delta\in H^n(M\times M)$, the Poincar√© dual of the diagonal $\Delta_*[M]\in H_*(M\times M)$. By the arguments in the referenced subsection, this is equivalent to taking the intersection product with the diagonal class $\Delta_* [M]$. The second map is induced by the projection to the first factor $M\times M\to M$.

    Let $u\in H_n(M, UTM)$ be the Thom class of the tangent bundle of $M$, it is shown in theorem \ref{thm:thom_class_dual} that this is Poincar√© dual to the zero section of the unit disk bundle of $TM$. Denote by $u_\Delta^c$ its image under the isomorphism $H_*(M\times M, \cConf_M(2)) \iso H_*(M, UTM)$. 
    
    We consider the following diagram. 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            H_*(M\times M) \dar["\capp u_\Delta"] \rar & H_*(M\times M, \cConf_M(2)) \dar["\capp u_\Delta^c"] & \lar["\iso"] H_*(M, UTM) \dar["\capp u"] \\
            H_{*-n}(M\times M) \dar["\pi_{1*}"] \rar & H_{*-n}(M\times M) \dar["\pi_{1*}"] & \lar["\Delta"] H_{*-n}(M) \dar \\
            H_{*-n}(M) \rar["\id"] & H_{*-n}(M) & \lar["\id"] H_{*-n}(M)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    
    Commutativity of the outer square implies our result that the two versions of the intersection product are identical. It is clear that all squares except for the upper left commute. 

    To show that the upper left square commutes, we need to show the following claim: the restriction $r\colon H^n(M\times M, \cConf_M(2)) \to H^n(M\times M)$ maps $u_\Delta^c$ to $u_\Delta$. To do so, we retrace the proof of lemma 4.2 in \cite{hutchings2011cup}. The claim is equivalent to $\Delta_*[M] = [M\times M]\capp r(u^c_\Delta) \in H^n(M\times M)$. To show this, consider the following diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            H_{2n}(M\times M) \otimes H^n(M\times M, \cConf_M(2)) \dar \rar & H_{2n}(M\times M) \otimes H^n(M\times M) \dar["\capp"] \\
            H_{2n}(M\times M, \cConf_M(2))\otimes H^n(M\times M, \cConf_M(2)) \rar["\capp"] \dar["\iso"] & H_n(M\times M) \\
            H_{2n}(M, UTM)\otimes H^n(M, UTM) \rar["\capp"] \dar["\iso"] & H_n(M) \uar \\
            H_{2n}(DTM, UTM)\otimes H^n(DTM, UTM) \arrow[ur, "\capp"] &
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    The lower and center left maps are the tensor product of two isomorphisms. The commutativity of the diagram is due to the naturality of the cap product. Now we chase $[M\times M]\otimes u_\Delta^c$ through the diagram, starting in the upper left and ending in the center right. The path through the top right maps it to $[M\times M]\capp r(u_\Delta^c)$. The fundamental class $[M\times M]$ is mapped via $H_2n(M\times M)\to H_{2n}(M\times M, \cConf_M(2))\to H_{2n}(M, UTM) \iso H_{2n}(DTM, UTM)$ to the fundamental class $[DTM]$. TODO: Actually give a proof of this.
    
    Thus $[M\times M]\otimes u_\Delta^c$ is mapped to $[DTM] \otimes u$. By theorem \ref{thm:thom_class_dual}, $[DTM] \capp u = [M]$ and we have shown $\Delta_*[M] = [M\times M]\capp r(u^c_\Delta)$. This shows the claim and hence concludes the proof.
\end{proof}


In comparison to the construction via tubular neighborhoods, which requires a choice of tubular neighborhood, this construction only requires a choice of equivalence between the cofibers of diagram~\ref{M_pushout}
\nocite{*} (and a construction of the unit tangent bundle).

\subsection{String Product (cohomology coproduct)}
The free loop space $LM$ is the pullback of the path space fibration $PM \to M\times M$ and the diagonal map $M\to M\times M$. As the first map is a fibration, this is in fact a homotopy pullback. %TODO Reference

By applying lemma \ref{lemma_pullback_cube} to the fibration $LM\times LM\to M\times M$, we obtain the following homotopy pushout diagram:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        LM\times LM|_{UTM} \rar\dar & LM\times LM |_{\cConf_M(2)} \dar \\
        LM\times LM|_M \rar & LM\times LM
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
where each term is the fiber product of $LM\times LM$ with the corresponding term in~\ref{M_pushout} over $M\times M$. Thus $LM\times LM|_M$ is the space of figure eights in $M$, i.e.\ two loops starting at the same point in $M$. $LM\times LM|_{UTM} = (LM\times LM)\times_{M\times M} UTM$ is the space of figure eights in $M$, together with a unit tangent vector at the node of the eight. $LM\times LM|_{\cConf_M(2)}$ is a space which contains pairs of loops which need not necessarily intersect, but if they intersect at $t=0$, then we additionally have a unit tangent vector at the node. 

Thus we can define a lifting of the intersection map:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        H^{*}(LM \times LM) & \lar H^*(LM\times LM, LM\times LM|_{\cConf_M(2)}) \dar["\iso"] & &\\
        & H^*(LM\times LM|_{M}, LM\times LM|_{UTM}) & \lar["\cupp Th"] H^{*-n}(LM\times LM|_M)
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
The map $H^*(LM\times LM|_{UTM}, LM\times LM|_M) \xleftarrow{"\cupp Th"} H^{*-n}(LM\times LM|_M)$ is given by taking the cup product with the pullback of the Thom class of $M$ along the map of pairs $(LM\times LM|_{M}, LM\times LM|_{UTM}) \to (M, UTM)$. The vertical map comes from the isomorphism of the cofibers. 

The string product is now the following map: 
\begin{align*}
    H^*(LM)\otimes H^*(LM) \from H^*(LM\times LM) \from H^{*-n}(LM\times LM|_M) \from H^{*-n}(LM),
\end{align*}
here the last map is induced by the map $LM\times LM|_M \to LM$, which is given by concatenation of loops with shared base point.

\subsection{String Coproduct (Cohomological Product)}

The coproduct is going to be defined relative to constant loops, i.e.
\begin{align*}
    H^*(LM, M) \from H^*(LM, M)\otimes H^*(LM, M)[n-1]
\end{align*}
where the $[n-1]$ denotes a shift of the index of the graded vector space by $n-1$. 

\paragraph{Splitting/Reparametrization Map} In place of the concatenation map in the previous subsection, we use here the splitting / reparametrization map, which will be a map on cohomology
\begin{align*}
    s^*\colon H^{*}(LM, M) \from H^{*+1}(\Map(\ocircle_2), LM\coprod_M LM),
\end{align*}
where $\Map(\ocircle_2, M) = \Map(\ocircle_2)$ is the space of loops in $M$ with two marked points at $t=0$ and $t=\frac 12$ (formally this is identical with $LM$, but there is a fibration $\Map(\ocircle_2, M)\to M\times M$) and $LM\coprod_M LM$ is the subspace of $\Map(\ocircle_2)$ such that one of the two paths is constant. This map can be thought of as mapping a loop $\gamma$ to the $t$-indexed family of path pairs $(\widehat{\gamma|_{[0, t]}}, \widehat{\gamma|_{[t, 1]}})$, where the hat represents a reparametrization of the paths. 

In more detail, let $s$ be the map 
\begin{align*}
    s\colon I\times LM & \to\Map(\ocircle_2),\\
    (t, \gamma) &\mapsto s\mapsto \begin{cases}
        \gamma(2 st) & \text{if}\ 0 \leq s \leq \frac 12\\
        \gamma(2t(1-s)+2(s-\frac 12))& \frac 12\leq s \leq 1
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
which splits the loop into the parts defined on the intervals $[0, t]$ and $[t, 1]$ and reparametrizes so they are defined on $[0, \frac 12]$ and $[\frac 12, 1]$ respectively. This is a map of pairs
\begin{align*}
    s\colon (I\times LM, \partial I\times LM \union I\times M) \to (\Map(\ocircle_2, M), LM\coprod_M LM).
\end{align*} 
By taking the product with (a representative of) the fundamental class of $S^1$, we obtain a suspension map on (e.g.\ singular) chains $ C_{*}(LM, M) \to C_{*+1}(I\times LM, \partial I \times LM \union I\times M)$ and composing its dual on cohomology with the previous map yields a map 
\begin{align*}
    s^*\colon H^{*}(LM, M) \from H^{*+1}(I\times LM, \partial I \times LM \union I\times M) \from H^{*+1}(\Map(\ocircle_2), LM\coprod_M LM)
\end{align*}
which is the map we intended to construct.

\paragraph{Intersection map} 
As the next step of the construction, we need an intersection map, which in homology can be thought of as intersecting a homology class in $\Map(\ocircle_2, M)$ with $\Map(8, M) \subset \Map(\ocircle_2, M)$. As we are still working with relative cohomology, this will be a map
\begin{align*}
    H^{*+n}(\Map(\ocircle_2, M), LM\coprod_M LM) \from H^*(\Map(8, M), LM \coprod_M LM)
\end{align*}

We apply \ref{lemma_pullback_cube} to the fibration $\Map(\ocircle_2)\to M\times M$. Thus we obtain the homotopy pushout

\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \Map'(8) \rar\dar &\Map'(\ocircle_2)\dar \\
        \Map(8) \rar & \Map(\ocircle_2)
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

where $\Map(8, M)$ consists of figure eight loops in $M$ and $\Map(\ocircle_2)$ consists of loops with an additional marked point, and in $\Map'(8)$ we again have an additional unit tangent vector at the node of the figure eight. We have again have an equivalence of cofibers $\Map(8) / \Map'(8) \iso \Map(\ocircle_2)/\Map'(\ocircle_2)$, and hence an equivalence of cofibers of cofibers
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\Map(\ocircle_2,M) / \Map'(\ocircle_2, M)} {(LM \coprod_M LM) } \iso \frac{(\Map(8,M) / \Map'(8, M)) }{(LM \coprod_M LM)}
\end{align*}

We now have a sequence of maps 
\begin{align*}
    H^*(\Map(\ocircle_2), LM\coprod_M LM) \from H^*(\Map(\ocircle_2)/ \Map'(\ocircle_2), LM\coprod_M LM) \\ \iso H^*(\Map(8) / \Map'(8), LM \coprod_M LM) \from H^{*-n}(\Map(8), LM \coprod_M LM)
\end{align*}
The last map is the cup product with the pullback of the Thom class $\tau\in H^n(M, UTM)$ along the map $H^*(\Map(8), \Map'(8)) \from H^*(M, UTM)$.

\paragraph{Definition of the string coproduct} Taking the two maps constructed in the previous paragraphs together, we get the coproduct:
\begin{align*}
    H^*(LM, M) \from H^{*+1}(\Map(\ocircle_2), LM \coprod_M LM) \\
    \from H^{*+1-n}(\Map(8), LM\coprod_M LM) \from H^*(LM, M)^{\otimes 2}[n-1]
\end{align*}
where the last map is induced by the inclusion $\Map(8)\to LM\times LM$.

\paragraph{The case $\chi(M) = 0$} We assume that $M$ has trivial Euler characteristic. Recall that the Thom class of $M$ maps to the Euler class under the sequence $H^n(DTM, UTM)\to H^n(DTM)\iso H^n(M)$ and hence if the Euler class is $0$, the Thom class is the coboundary of some class in $H^{n-1}(TM_0)\iso H^{n-1}(UTM)$.

The splitting / reparametrization map is obtained via the same formula as before, but it is now a map $H^*(LM) \from H^{*+1}(\Map(\ocircle_2), \Map(8))$. The intersection map is now a map $H^*(\Map(\ocircle_2), \Map(8)) \from H^{*-n}(\Map(8))$, which is given as the sequence of maps
\begin{align*}
    H^*(\Map(\ocircle_2), \Map(8)) \\ \from H^*(\Map'(\ocircle_2), \Map'(8)) \xleftarrow{\delta} H^{*-1}(\Map'(8)) \from H^{*-n-1}(\Map(8))
\end{align*}

This neighborhood is homotopy equivalent to the total space of the pullback bundle $ev^*(\nu(\Delta)) = ev^*(TM)$. The intersection map is defined as the composition
    \begin{align*}
        H^*(LM\times LM) \from H^*(LM\times LM, LM\times_M LM) \iso H^*(\nu(\tilde\Delta), \nu(\tilde\Delta)_0) \\

\section{Cochain Complex Models}
\subsection{Differential Forms on Path Spaces}

We quickly recall how one can define differential forms on spaces such as $PM$ and $LM$. We first equip a space $X$ with a structure that measure smoothness via maps from finite dimensional euclidean spaces.

\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a nonempt set, a \emph{diffeology} $\mathcal D=\mathcal D_X$ on $X$ is a set of so called \emph{plots} $P\colon U\to X$ defined on open $U\subset \R^n$, where $n$ is not fixed, such that 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item every constant map $U\to \{x\}\subset X$ is a plot,
        \item for every map $P\colon U\to X$, if for every point $r\in U$ there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $r$ such that $P|_V$ is a plot, then $P$ is also a plot,
        \item For every plot $P\colon U\to X$ and every smooth $F\colon V\to U$, the pullback $P\comp F\colon V\to X$ is a plot.
    \end{enumerate}
    A set together with a specified diffeology is called a \emph{diffeological space}. 
\end{definition}

There is a related notion of a differentiable space, coined by Chen, where one uses convex sets instead of open sets. 

\begin{example}\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Any topological space can be equipped with its topological diffeology, in which the plots are all continuous maps $U\to X$.
    \item Any smooth manifold $M$ is a diffeological space, where the plots are the smooth maps $U\to M$.
    \item Given two diffeological spaces $X, Y$, the cartesian product $X\times Y$ is a diffeological space, where a map $P\colon U\to X\times Y$ is a plot if and only if the projections $\pi_X \comp P \colon U\to X$ and $\pi_Y\comp P\colon U\to Y$ are plots of $X$ resp.\ $Y$.
    \item Given a diffeological space $X$ and a subset $A$, one can define the diffeology on $A$ by taking plots of $A$ to be those plots of $X$ which map into $A$.
\end{enumerate}\end{example}
\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ and $X'$ be two diffeological spaces. A map $f\colon X\to X'$ is said to be smooth, if for each plot $P$ of $X$, $f\comp P$ is a plot of $X'$. The set of smooth maps from $X$ to $X'$ is denoted $C^\infty(X, X')$ or $\mathcal D(X, X')$.
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    There is a diffeology on $\mathcal D(X, X')$ in which a map $P\colon U\to \mathcal D(X, X')$ is a diffeology if and only if for every plot $Q\colon V\to X$, the parametrization $U\times V\to X', (r,s)\mapsto P(r)(Q(s))$ is a plot of $X'$. 
    
    Using this diffeology, the evaluation map $ev\colon X\times C^\infty(X, X') \to X'$ and composition map $\mathcal D(X, X')\times \mathcal D(X', X'')\to \mathcal D(X, X'')$ are smooth.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
    A differential $k$-form on a diffeological space $(X,\mathcal D)$ is a $\mathcal D$-indexed collection $\alpha_P$ of differential forms $\alpha_P\in \Omega^k(U_P)$ for each plot $P\colon U\to X$, such that for every smooth map $f\colon U\to V$ of euclidean open sets, $f^*\alpha_P = \alpha_{fP}$. The collection of all differential $k$-forms on $X$ is denoted $\Omega^*(X)$.
\end{definition}
If $M$ is a smooth manifold with its smooth diffeology, the $k$-forms according to this definition are just the regular $k$-forms. 

One can define the usual operations on differential forms such as pullback along smooth maps, exterior derivative and wedge product.

TODO: Maybe remove this
\begin{definition}
    The \emph{topology of a diffeological space} $X$ is the coarsest topology such that all plots $P\colon U\to X$ are continuous. 
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[Application to Path Spaces] We can define a diffeology on $PM$, and $LM$ by calling a map $U\to PM$ resp.\ $U\to LM$ a plot if its adjoint $I\times U\to M$ resp.\ $S^1\times U\to M$ is a map of smooth manifolds. The space $\Omega M\subset LM$ is equipped with the subspace diffeology. Thus we have definitions of $\Omega^*(PM)$, $\Omega^*(LM)$ and $\Omega^*(\Omega M)$. Note that we have to use the space of smooth paths resp.\ loops here. 
\end{remark}

\paragraph{Singular and Smooth Homology} A topological diffeological space $X$ is a space which has both a topology and a diffeology, such that all the maps in the diffeology are continuous. There are two simplicial sets associated to such $X$: its singular simplicial set $S(X)$ which consists of all continuous maps $\Delta^n\to X$ for all $X$, and the smooth simplicial set $S^\infty(X)$ which consists of all smooth maps $\Delta^n\to X$ for all $n$; Denote by $C_*(X)$ resp.\ $C_*^\infty(X)$ the corresponding chain complexes (and similarly $C^*_\infty(X)$ the associated cochain complex). The following lemma gives a sufficient condition for the smooth and continuous homology to be identical.
\begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ be a topological diffeological space such that for every continuous simplex $\sigma\colon \Delta^n\to M$ with smooth $(n-1)$-faces, $n\geq 1$, there exists a continuous homotopy $h\colon \Delta^n\times I\to X$ relative to the boundary $\partial\Delta^n$ from $\sigma$ to a smooth $n$-simplex of $X$. Then the canonical map $S^\infty(X) \to S(X)$ is a chain homotopy equivalence. 
\end{lemma}
See \cite{chen1977iterated} or \cite{parkproof}. This is a standard argument: one constructs a converse map $S(X)\to S^\infty(X)$ inductively by mapping each continuous simplex with a fixed smooth approximation, such that the approximations are compatible at the boundary. 

For smooth manifolds the hypothesis of the lemma is satisfied by Whitney's Approximation theorem, see \cite[Theorem 6.26]{lee2003introduction}
\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $Y$ a smooth manifold without boundary, and let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a continuous map, smooth on a closed (possibly empty) subset $A\subset X$. Then $f$ is homotopic relative to $A$ to a smooth map $X\to Y$.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Homotopy Invariance}
\begin{theorem}
    Let $f_0, f_1\colon M'\to M$ be smooth maps of diffeological spaces. Then every smooth homotopy $F\colon I\times M'\to M$ from $f_0$ to $f_1$ induces a chain homotopy $\int_F\colon \Omega^*(M)\to \Omega^*(M')$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
        d\int_F + \int_F d = f_1^* - f_0^*
    \end{align*}
\end{theorem}
This is \cite[Lemma 1.4.1]{chen1977iterated}. In particular if $M$ is smoothly contractible, then the cohomology of $\Omega^*(M)$ is isomorphic to that of a point.

Let $\mathcal U$ be an open cover of $X$ and let $C_n^{\infty,\mathcal U}(X)$ be the subgroup of $C_n^\infty(X)$ generated by smooth simplices with image contained entirely in some set in the cover $\mathcal U$. This is again a chain complex.
\begin{theorem}
    The inclusion $\iota\colon C_n^{\infty,\mathcal U}(X) \to C_n^{\mathcal U}(X)$ is a chain homotopy equivalence.
\end{theorem}
This is well known for singular homology, and the proof in \cite{hatcher2002algebraic} by barycentric subdivision works in the diffeological setting too, as all the maps involved in the subdivision are smooth.

\begin{theorem}
    If $X$ is a paracompact locally smoothly contractible diffeological space, then the de Rham map $\int\colon \Omega^*(X)\to C^*_\infty(X)$ is a quasi-isomorphism. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    First consider the case that $X$ is (globally) smoothly contractible. There is a commutative diagram
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \Omega^*(X) \rar["\int"] & C^*_{\infty}(X)\\
        \Omega^*(*) \uar\rar["\int"] & C^*_{\infty}(*) \uar 
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    where $*$ is the one point space. By homotopy invariance, the vertical maps are quasi-isomorphisms, the lower horizontal map is a quasi-isomorphism and hence the upper de Rham map is also a quasi-isomorphism.

    For an open set $U$, let $\underline\R(U)$ be the locally constant functions $U\to \R$. Since $X$ is locally contractible, connectedness is equivalent to path connectedness and each connected component of $U$ is open. We have a commutative diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \underline\R(U) \ar[rd]\rar& \Omega^0(U)\dar["\int"] \\
            & C^0_\infty(U)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    and hence a commutative diagram of complexes of sheaves
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
        \underline{\R} \rar\ar[rd] & \Omega^*\dar["\int"] \\
        & \hat C^*_\infty
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    Here $\underline{\R}$ is the sheaf of locally constant functions on $X$, which is identified with the complex of sheaves $\dots\to 0\to\underline\R\to 0\to\dots$ and $\hat C^*_\infty$ is the complex of sheafifications of the complex of presheaves $C^*_\infty$.
    % \begin{tikzcd}
    %     \Omega^*(X) \rar 
    %     \Omega^*(U) \rar C^*_{\infty}(U)
    % \end{tikzcd}
\end{proof}



\subsection{Model for Path Spaces}

Let $M$ be a (compact simply connected) manifold. We write $A=\Omega^*(M)$. 

Denote by $B = B(A, A, A)$ the two sided bar construction
\begin{align*}
    B(A, A, A) = B\otimes T(A[1]) \otimes A = \sum_{n\geq 0} A\otimes A[1]^{\otimes n} \otimes A
\end{align*}
Its differential is given by $d_B = d_0 + d_1$ where $d_0$ is given by the differential on $A$:
\begin{align*}
    &d_0(\omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|\omega_n]\omega_{n+1}) = - d\omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|\omega_n]\omega_{n+1} - \\
    &\quad \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^{\varepsilon_{i-1}} \omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|d\omega_i|\dots|\omega_n]\omega_{n+1} - (-1)^{\varepsilon_{n}} \omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|\omega_n]d\omega_{n+1}
\end{align*}
with $\varepsilon_i = \deg\omega_0+\dots\omega_i - (i-1)$. The differential $d_1$ is defined via the multiplication on $A$:
\begin{align*}
    &d_1(\omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|\omega_n]\omega_{n+1}) = -(-1)^{\varepsilon_0}\omega_0\omega_1[\omega_2|\dots|\omega_n]\omega_{n+1} - \\&\quad\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{\varepsilon_i}\omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|\omega_i|\omega_{i+1}\omega_n]\omega_{n+1} - (-1)^{\varepsilon_{n}}\omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|\omega_{n-1}]\omega_{n}\omega_{n+1}
\end{align*}

For properties of the bar construction, see \ref{subseq:bar_construction}. 

The standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ is the set $\{0\leq t_1\leq t_2\leq \dots\leq t_n\leq 1\} \subset \R^n$. Let 
\begin{align*}
    ev_n\colon\qquad\Delta^n\times PM \to & M\times M^n\times M \\
    ((t_1,\dots, t_n), \gamma)\mapsto &(\gamma(0), \gamma(t_1), \dots, \gamma(t_n), \gamma(1))
\end{align*}
In \ref{subsec:fiber_integration} we introduce a fiber integral map which we apply to the map $\Delta^n\times PM \to PM$: 
$$\int_{\Delta^n}\colon \Omega^*(\Delta^n\times PM) \to \Omega^{*-n}(PM).$$

\paragraph{De Rham Iterated Integral Map} The iterated integral map is the map 
\begin{align*}
    \int&\colon B(\Omega^*(M), \Omega^*(M), \Omega^*(M)) \to \Omega^*(PM) \\
    \int&= \sum_{n\geq 0} \int_{\Delta^n}\phantom{|} \comp ev_n^*
\end{align*}
which acts on each summand as 
\begin{align*}
    \Omega^*(M)\otimes\Omega^*(M)[1]^n\otimes\Omega^*(M)\to \Omega^{*+n}(M^{n+2})\xto{ev^*}\Omega^{*+n}(\Delta^n\times PM) \xto{\int_{\Delta^n}} \Omega^{*}(PM)
\end{align*}

Following \cite{getzler1991differential} and \cite{chen1976reduced} we introduce the following normalization of the bar complex $B$. For $f\in C^\infty(M)$, let $$S_i(f)\left(\omega_0[\omega_1| \dots| \omega_k]\omega_{k+1}\right) = \omega_0[\omega_1| \dots |\omega_{i-1}| f | \omega_i| \dots| \omega_k]\omega_{k+1}\in B$$ and $R_i(F) = d S_i(f) - S_i(f) d$ where $d$ is the differential of $B$. Let $D$ be the subspace of $B$ generated by $S_i(f)$ and $R_i(f)$.
\begin{lemma}
    The iterated integral is a chain map $B\to \Omega^*(PM)$. $D$ is a sub-chain complex of $C$. The iterated integral vanishes on $D$ and hence descends to a map $B/D\to\Omega^*(PM)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Recall the Stokes' theorem for the fiber integral: $d\int_{F} \omega = \int_{F}d\omega + (-1)^{\deg \omega - \dim F} \int_{\partial F}\omega$. Thus
    \begin{align*}
        % d\left(\int \omega_0\otimes\dots\otimes\omega_{n+1}\right) =& \int_{\Delta^n} ev^*\left(d\left((\pi^*\omega_0)\wedge\dots\wedge(\pi^*\omega_{n+1})\right)\right) \\&+ (-1)^{d-n} \int_{\partial\Delta^n} ev^*(\pi^*\omega_0)\wedge\dots\wedge(\pi^*\omega_{n+1}) \\
        % =& \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^{\deg\omega_0+\dots+\deg\omega_{i-1}} \int\omega_0\otimes\dots d\omega_i\dots\otimes\omega_{n+1}\\
        % &+(-1)^{d-n}\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i\int_{\Delta^{n-1}} ev^*((\pi^*\omega_0)\dots(\pi^*(\omega_{i}\wedge\omega_{i+1}))\dots(\pi^*\omega_{n+1})) \\
        % =& \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^{\deg\omega_0+\dots+\deg\omega_{i-1}} \int\omega_0\otimes\dots d\omega_i\dots\otimes\omega_{n+1}\\
        % &+(-1)^{d-n}\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i\int\omega_0\otimes\dots\otimes \omega_i\wedge\omega_{i+1}\otimes\dots\omega_{n+1}
        d\left(\int \omega_0\otimes\dots\otimes\omega_{n+1}\right) =& \int_{\Delta^n} ev^*\left(d\left((\pi_0^*\omega_0)\wedge\dots\wedge(\pi_{n+1}^*\omega_{n+1})\right)\right) \\&\pm \int_{\partial\Delta^n} ev^*(\pi_0^*\omega_0)\wedge\dots\wedge(\pi_{n+1}^*\omega_{n+1}) 
        \intertext{On the $i$-th face $\partial_i\Delta^n$, we have $t_i=t_{i+1}$ (with $t_0=0, t_{n+1}=1$) so $(\dots\times\pi_i\times\dots)\comp ev=(\dots\times\pi_{i+1}\times\dots)\comp ev$.}
        =& \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} \pm \int\omega_0\otimes\dots d\omega_i\dots\otimes\omega_{n+1}\\
        &\pm\sum_{i=0}^n \int_{\partial_i\Delta^n} ev^*((\pi_0^*\omega_0)\dots(\pi_i^*(\omega_{i}\wedge\omega_{i+1}))\dots(\pi_{n+1}^*\omega_{n+1})) 
        \intertext{Reparametrization through the maps $\Delta^{n-1}\to\partial_i\Delta^n$ yields:}

        &\pm\sum_{i=0}^n \pm\int\omega_0\otimes\dots\otimes \omega_i\wedge\omega_{i+1}\otimes\dots\omega_{n+1}
    \end{align*}
    TODO: Nail down signs.

    It is easy to check that $D$ is a sub-chain complex of $B$. 

    We need to check that the iterated integral maps $D$ to $0$. Since only the $i+1$-th factor of the image of $ev_n$ depends on $t_i$, the pullback $ev^*(\omega_0\times\dots\times\omega_{n+1})$ can not contain the factor $dt_i$ if $\omega_{i+1}$ is a $0$-form. Hence any image of $S_i(f)$ is mapped to $0$ by the iterated integral. For $R_i(f)$, one can compute that  
    \begin{align*}
        &R_i(f)(\omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|\hat\omega_i|\dots|\omega_{n}]\omega_{n+1}) = \pm \left( (-1)^{\deg\omega_0+\dots+\deg\omega_{i-1}} \omega_0[\omega_1|\dots| \omega_{i-1}| df| \omega_{i+1}|\dots|\omega_{n}]\omega_{n+1} \right.\\&\quad\left. + \omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|(\omega_{i-1}f)|\omega_{i+1}|\dots\omega_n]\omega_{n+1} - \omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|(\omega_{i-1})|f\omega_{i+1}|\dots\omega_n]\omega_{n+1} \right)
    \end{align*}
    The iterated integral of the first summand is 
    \begin{align*}
        &\int \omega_0[\omega_1|\dots| \omega_{i-1}| df| \omega_{i+1}|\dots|\omega_{n}]\omega_{n+1} = \int_{\Delta^{n-1}}\int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} ev_{n}^*(\omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|df|\dots|\omega_n]\omega_{n+1} \\
        &\quad= (-1)^{\deg\omega_0+\dots+\deg\omega_{i-1}}\int_{\Delta^{n-1}}\left(\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i+1}} ev_{\{i\}}^*df\right) \wedge ev_{n-1}^*(\omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|df|\dots|\omega_n]\omega_{n+1}) \\
        &\quad= (-1)^{\deg\omega_0+\dots+\deg\omega_{i-1}}\int_{\Delta^{n-1}}\left(f(ev_{\{i-1\}})-f(ev_{\{i+1\}})\right) ev_{n-1}^*(\omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|df|\dots|\omega_n]\omega_{n+1}) \\
        &\quad= (-1)^{\deg\omega_0+\dots+\deg\omega_{i-1}} \int \omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|\omega_{i-1} f|\omega_{i+1}|\dots|\omega_{n}]\omega_{n+1} \\
        &\quad\hphantom{= }-(-1)^{\deg\omega_0+\dots+\deg\omega_{i-1}} \int \omega_0[\omega_1|\dots|\omega_{i-1} |f\omega_{i+1}|\dots|\omega_{n}]\omega_{n+1}
    \end{align*}
    where $ev_{\{i\}}\colon \Delta^n\times PM\to M, \left((t_1, \dots, t_n), \gamma\right)\mapsto \gamma(i)$,
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Singular Iterated Integral Map} In singular cochains, one can use
\begin{align*}
    \int&\colon B(C^*(M), C^*(M), C^*(M)) \to C^*(PM) \\
    \int&= \sum_{n\geq 0} (\blank \slant [\Delta^n]) \comp ev_n^*
\end{align*}
which is a direct sum of the maps 
\begin{align*}
    C^*(M)\otimes C^*(M)[1]^{\otimes n} \otimes C^{*+n}(M) \xto{ev^*} C^{*+n}(\Delta^n\times PM) \xto{\blank / [\Delta^n]} C^{*}(PM)
\end{align*}
By the remarks in \ref{subsec:fiber_integration}, this map is identified with the previous map through the De Rham isomorphism.

\begin{remark}
    This map descends to a map $NB(C^*(M), C^*(M), C^*(M)) \to NC^*(M)$, where $NC^*(M)$ is the normalized singular cochain complex, i.e. the quotient by the images of the degeneracy maps $s_i$ and  $NB(C^*(M), C^*(M), C^*(M)) = \bigoplus C^*(M)\otimes \bar C^*(M)^{\otimes n}\otimes C^*(M)$ is the normalization of the bar complex, where $\bar C^*(M)$ is the complex with $\bar C^0(M) / 1$ and $\bar C^k(M) = C^k(M)$ for $k\neq 0$. To show this, consider the diagram

    \begin{tikzcd}
        C^*(PM) & \lar["/\Delta^n"] C^{*+n}(PM\times \Delta^n) &\lar C^*(M)^{\otimes n} \\
        C^*(PM) \uar["="] & \lar["/s_i"] C^{*+n}(PM\times\Delta^{n-1})\uar["(\id\times s_i)^*"] & \lar C^*(M)^{\otimes (n-1)}\uar["\pi_{\hat i}"]
    \end{tikzcd}

    where $s_i\colon\Delta^n\to\Delta^{n-1}$ and $\pi_{\hat i}\colon M^{n}\to M^{n-1}$ both forget the $i$-th component. The slant product with a degenerate simplex yields a degenerate cochain: $\langle u / s_i\alpha, \beta\rangle = \langle u,s_i\times\beta\rangle$ and one can show that the cross product of a degenerate simplex with another chain is a sum of degenerate chains, so the slant product $u/s_i$ is a sum of degenerate cochains. 
\end{remark}

We also exhibit the homology version
\begin{align*}
    C_*(PM) \xto{\times [\Delta^n]} C_{*+n}(PM\times \Delta^n) \xto{ev_*} C_{*+n}(M\times M^n\times M)\to C_*(M)\otimes C_{*}(M)[1]^{\otimes n}\otimes C_*(M),
\end{align*}
but the natural target of this map is the direct product of the right hand side complexes, so the iterated integral map in on the bar complex is not on the nose the dual of a map in a homological chain complex.


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:path_models_1}
    Let $A=\Omega^*(M)$. The iterated integral map $$\int\colon B(A, A, A)\to \Omega^*(PM)$$ is a quasi-isomorphism of algebras. Further consider the following maps: constant path inclusion $M\to PM$, evaluation at the start and end point $PM\to M\times M$ and composition of paths $PM\times_M PM\to PM$. The following diagrams commute:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        B \rar \dar & \Omega^*(PM) \dar \\
        A \rar & \Omega^*(M)
    \end{tikzcd}
    \qquad\qquad\qquad
    \begin{tikzcd}
        B \rar & \Omega^*(PM) \\
        \uar A\otimes A \rar & \Omega^*(M\times M) \uar
    \end{tikzcd}
    \\
    \begin{tikzcd}
        B \rar \dar & \Omega^*(PM) \dar \\
        B \otimes_A B \rar & \Omega(PM\times_M PM)
    \end{tikzcd}
    \qquad
    \begin{tikzcd}
        B\otimes B\dar \rar["\int\otimes\int"]&\Omega^*(PM)\otimes\Omega^*(PM) \dar["\wedge"]\\
        B \rar["\int"] & \Omega^*(PM)
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    and each of the horizontal maps is a quasi-isomorphism.
\end{theorem}

The map $B\to A$ in the first diagram is induced by the multiplication $A\otimes A\to A$ and the zero map on the higher summands in $B$. The map $A\otimes A\to B$ is the inclusion into the direct sum.

The lower horizontal map in the third diagram is the map 
\begin{align*}
    B\otimes_A B\xto{\int\otimes_A\int} \Omega^*(PM)\otimes_{\Omega^*(M)}\Omega^*(PM) \to \Omega^*(PM\times_M PM)
\end{align*}
and the left vertical map is induced by deconcatenation maps $A\otimes \bar A[1]^{\otimes n} \to A\otimes \bar A[1]^{\otimes k} \otimes A \otimes \bar A[1]^{\otimes l} \otimes A$ which act on elements as: $a(a_1|\dots|a_n)a'\mapsto \sum_{k+l=n} a(a_1|\dots|a_k) 1 (a_{k+1}|\dots|a_{k+l}) a'$.

The left vertical map in the fourth diagram is the map 
\begin{proof}
For the commutativity of the first diagram, consider the following diagram:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
    \Omega^*(M) & \lar["\int_{\Delta^n}"] \Omega^{*+n}(M\times \Delta^n) & \lar["p_M"] \Omega^{*+n}(M) \\
    \Omega^*(PM) \uar["const^*"] &\lar["\int_{\Delta^n}"] \Omega^*(PM\times\Delta^n) \uar["const^*\otimes\id"] & \lar{ev^*}\Omega^*(M) \otimes \Omega^{*+n}(M^n) \otimes \Omega^{*+n}(M) \uar["\Delta^*"]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The upper row is $0$ unless $n=0$, as a pullback of a form on the base space vanishes on all vectors tangent to the fiber direction and hence the fiber integral vanishes.

The first diagram can be used to show that the iterated integral map is a quasi isomorphism: the bottom and right arrows are quasi-isomorphisms and it is known that the left arrow is also a quasi-isomorphism (see \ref{thm:bar_resolution}). The statement that this is a quasi-isomorphism is also a special case of theorem 2 in \cite{patras2003cochain}. 

For the fourth diagram, let $a_0[a_1|\dots|a_n]a_{n+1} \in A\otimes A[1]^{\otimes n}\otimes A$ and $b_0[b_1|\dots|b_m]b_{m+1} \in A\otimes A[1]^{\otimes n}\otimes A$. This gets mapped through the upper right path to 
\begin{align*}
    &\int_{\Delta^n}ev_n^*(\pi_0^*a_0\dots\pi_{n+1}a_{n+1}) \wedge \int_{\Delta^m} ev_m^*(\pi_0^*b_0\dots\pi_{m+1}b_{m+1}) \\
    = & \int_{\Delta^{n}\times\Delta^m} ev^*_{n,m}(\pi^*_0 a_0 \dots \pi_{n+1}^*a_{n+1}\pi^*_{n+2}b_0\dots\pi^*_{m+n+2}b_{m+1})
    \intertext{Here $ev_{n,m}\colon \Delta^n\times\Delta^m\times PM\to M^{n+m+4}$, so we've pulled back along the diagonal $PM\to PM\times PM$. Now by an Eilenberg Zilber argument, $\Delta^{n}\times\Delta^m$ splits into the (smooth singular) simplices $s_{\nu}(\Delta^n) \times s_{\mu}(\Delta^m)$ with orientation sign $\sgn(\mu,\nu)$, where $(\mu,\nu)\in \Sh(n,m)$ are the shuffle permutations of $m+n$ elements and $s_{\mu}\times s_{\nu}\colon \Delta^n\times\Delta^m\to\Delta^{n+m}$.}
    =& \sum_{(\mu,\nu)\in\Sh(n,m)} \sgn(\mu,\nu) \int_{s_{\mu}\times s_{\nu}} \dots \\
    =& \sum_{(\mu,\nu)\in\Sh(n,m)} \sgn(\mu,\nu) \int_{\Delta^{n+m}} (s_{\mu}\times s_{\nu})^*ev^*_{n,m} \dots \\
    =& \sum_{(\mu,\nu)\in\Sh(n,m)} \sgn(\mu,\nu) \int_{\Delta^{n+m}} ev^*_{n+m}\left(\pi^*_0(a_0)\pi_1^*(a_{\mu(1)})\dots \pi_n^*(a_{\mu(n)})\pi_{n+1}^*(a_{n+1}) \right.\\ & \left. \pi_{n+1+1}^*(b_{0}) \pi_{n+3}^*(b_{\nu(1)})\dots\pi_{n+m+3}^*(b_m)\pi_{n+m+4}^*(b_{m+1})\right) \\
    =& \pm \sum_{(\mu,\nu)\in\Sh(n,m)} \int (a_0 b_0) [a_{\mu(1)}|\dots|a_{\mu(n)}|b_{\nu(1)}|\dots|b_{\nu(m)}](a_n b_m)
\end{align*}

TODO: Check diagram 3 and quasi-iso in diagram 3.
\end{proof}

Let $A^e=A^{op}\otimes A$. 

\begin{theorem}
    The following maps are quasi-isomorphisms if $M$ is connected and simply connected.
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=.27em, column sep=2cm]
        B\otimes_{A^e} A\rar["\int\otimes\id_A"]& \Omega^*(LM)\\
        (B\otimes_A B)\otimes_{A^e} A \rar["(\int\otimes_A\int)\otimes\id_A"] &\Omega^*(\Map(\ocircle_2, M))\\
        B\otimes_{A^e\otimes A^e} B \rar["\int\otimes \int"] &\Omega^*(\Map(8, M))
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This follows from the Pullback Pushout lemma, see \ref{subsec:eilenberg_moore}. For example for the first statement, $LM$ is the homotopy pullback of the cospan $M\xto{\Delta} M\times M\from PM$ - as the projection $PM\to M$ is a fibration, the ordinary pullback coincides with the homotopy pullback. The loop space is modeled as cochain algebras by the span $A\from A\otimes A \to B$. TODO: Show that the homotopy pushout in this case is just the pushout.
\end{proof}

The simplicial analog of this is a consequence of theorem 2 in \cite{patras2003cochain}: All the spaces on the right are mapping spaces $\Map(|K|, M)$ for some simplicial set $K$ of dimension $1$ (i.e.\ the maximal degree of nondegenerate simplices is $1$) and $M$ is simply connected. In \cite{patras2003cochain} a general construction for an iterated integral map is given in this setting. 


\paragraph{Model for the concatenation and splitting map} Consider the concatenation of loops map $LM\times_M LM\to LM$ and the splitting map $s\colon I\times LM\to \Map(\ocircle_2, M)$. The concatenation is induced by the map on paths $PM\times_M PM \to PM$ as in theorem \ref{thm:path_models_1}. The splitting map is induced by a map on paths $I\times PM \to PM\times_M PM$.

Before we model these maps on chain complexes, we introduce a model of the interval $\mathcal I = \R (1-t) \oplus \R t \oplus \R dt\subset \Omega^*(I)$, the space of Whitney forms on the interval. There is a projection 
\begin{align*}
    \Omega^*(I) &\to \mathcal I\\
    f&\mapsto f(0)(1-t) + f(1) t + \left(\int_I f\right) dt
\end{align*}
which is a quasi-isomorphism with quasi-inverse given by the inclusion $\mathcal I \subset \Omega^*(I)$. 


\begin{theorem}
    The following diagrams commute:

    \begin{tikzcd}
        (B\otimes B)\otimes_{A^e\otimes A^e} A\rar &\Omega^*(LM\times_M LM) \\
        B\otimes_{A^e}A \uar\rar & \Omega^*(LM) \uar

    \end{tikzcd}

\section{Thom Isomorphism and Poincar√© Duality}
We state some classical results relating to the Thom Isomorphism theorem and Poincar√© Duality. We use homology with $\Z$-coefficients throughout, but other coefficient systems may be used, if the definition of orientation is adjusted correspondingly.


\subsection{Poincar√© Duality}
Let $M$ be a compact orientable manifold of dimension $n$ with boundary $\partial M$. Since $M$ is oriented, one can assign to any $p\in M\setminus \partial M$ canonically a homology class $z_p\in H_n(M, M\setminus \{p\})$ which describes the orientation at $p$.
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:poincare_duality}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item There exists a \emph{fundamental class} $[M]\in H_n(M,\partial M)$, such that for any $p\in M\setminus \partial M$, we have $[M]|_{(M, M\setminus\{p\})} = z_p\in H_n(U, U\setminus \{p\})$.
    \item If $\partial M = A \union B$ is the union of two compact $(n-1)$-dimensional manifolds with common boundary $\partial A = \partial B = A\isect B$, then the cap product with $[M]$ gives an isomorphism
    \begin{align*}
        H^k(M, A) \to H_{n-k}(M, B).
    \end{align*}
    \item In particular, there are isomorphisms
    \begin{align*}
        H^k(M) \to H_{n-k}(M, \partial M) \\
        H^k(M,\partial M) \to H_{n-k}(M).
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

This is \cite[Thm 3.43]{hatcher2002algebraic} and the surrounding material.

\subsection{Thom Isomorphism}
Let $\xi$ be a rank $n$ vector bundle $E\xrightarrow{\pi} B$ and let $E_0$ be $E$ minus the zero section. Let $UE\to DE$ be the inclusion of the unit sphere bundle of $E$ into its unit disk bundle, then the homotopy cofibers of $UE\to DE$ and $E_0\to E$ are homotopy equivalent and the space $Th(\xi) = DE / UE$ is called the Thom space of $\xi$. 

If $\xi$ is oriented, one can assign canonically to every fiber $F=\pi^{-1}(b)$ a cohomology class $u_F\in H^n(F, F_0)$, such that the assignments are locally compatible.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $\xi$ be an oriented rank $n$ vector bundle with paracompact base space.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item There exists a unique cohomology class $u=u(\xi)\in H^n(E, E_0)$ such that $u|_F = u_F\in H^n(F, F_0)$. This is called the \emph{Thom class} or fundamental class of $\xi$.
        \item The following map is an isomorphism
        \begin{align*}
            y \mapsto y\cupp u, \quad H^*(E) \to H^{n+*}(E, E_0)    
        \end{align*}
        \item The following map is an isomorphism
        \begin{align*}
            \eta \mapsto \eta\capp u, \quad H_{*+n}(E, E_0) \to H^{*}(E)
        \end{align*}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The \emph{Thom isomorphism} is one of the following compositions of isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
    \Phi^*\colon H^*(B)\xrightarrow{\pi^*}H^*(E)\xrightarrow{\cupp u}H^{*+n}(E, E_0) \\
    \Phi^*\colon H_{*+n}(E, E_0) \xrightarrow{\capp u} H_*(E)\xrightarrow{\pi_*}H_*(B)
\end{align*}

For a detailed proof, see \cite{milnor1974characteristic}. We give a quick sketch of the proof there. One first verifies that the theorem holds for trivial vector bundles, i.e.\ cross products. Using a Mayer-Vietoris argument one then shows that it holds on finite unions of trivialization domains, in particular on compact base spaces. For the general cases, one uses that homology is a colimit indexed by compact spaces.

There is an interpretation of the homological Thom isomorphism as taking the intersection with the zero section. We state this cleanly in \ref{thm:thom_iso_intersection} after introducing umkehr maps. This is a consequence of the following. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:thom_class_dual}
    Let $E\to M$ be a smooth orientable rank $r$ vector bundle over a compact orientable manifold with boundary $\partial M$. Then the Thom class $u=u(E)\in H^r(E, E_0)$ is Poincare dual to the zero section of $E$: After choosing a metric, let $DE$ and $SE$ be the unit ball resp.\ sphere bundles of $E$ and $[DE]\in H^{r+n}(DE, SE)$ the fundamental class, then
    \begin{align*}
        [DE] \capp u = [M]\in H_n(DE)
    \end{align*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
    In a trivialization domain $U$, one has $E|_U = U \times \R^r$ and the orientation classes are given as follows. The restriction of $u$ to $(E|_U, E_0|_U)$ is the pullback of a class in the fiber direction: $u|_U = \pi_{D^r}^{*}\left(u_{(D^r, S^{r-1})}\right)\in H^*(E|_U, E_0|_U)$, for some $u_{(D^r, S^{r-1})}\in H^*(D^r, S^{r-1})$. The fundamental class $[DE]$ is locally a cross product: at any $p\in U$, one has $[DE]|_{(DE|_U, DE|_{U\setminus\{p\}})} = [M]|_{(U, U\setminus\{p\})} \times [D^r] \in H^*(E|_U, E|_{U\setminus\{p\}} \union E_0|_{U})$. Thus $[DE]|_{(DE|_U, DE|_{U\setminus\{p\}})} \capp u|_U = [M]|_{(U, U\setminus\{p\})}$.
\end{proof}

For an alternative proof, this is lemma 4.1 in \cite{hutchings2011cup}. 


\subsection{Euler Class}\label{subsec:euler_class}
\begin{definition}
    Let $\xi$ be an oriented rank $r$ vector bundle. The Euler class $e(\xi)\in H^r(B)$ of $\xi$ is image of the Thom class $u\in H^r(E, E_0)$ under the composition of maps $H^r(E, E_0)\to H^r(E)\xleftarrow{\iso} H^r(B)$.
\end{definition}
Equivalently, the Euler class is the class that corresponds to $u\cupp u$ under the Thom isomorphism, since $\phi(e) = p^*(e) \cupp u = j^*(u)\cupp u = u\cupp u$, for $p\colon E\to B$ and $j^*\colon H^*(E, E_0) \to H^*(E)$. 
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:euler_class}
    If $M$ is a smooth closed orientable manifold of dimension $n$ and $\xi=TM$ is its tangent bundle, then its Euler characteristic is 
    \begin{align*}
        \chi(M) = \langle e(TM), [M]\rangle.
    \end{align*}
    More generally, under the hypotheses of \ref{thm:thom_class_dual}, letting $s\colon B\to E$ be a section, the Euler class is Poincar√© dual to the intersection $p_*(s_*[B]\capp s_*[B])\in H^{n-r}(B)$ of two sections in $E$.
\end{theorem}

The second part is \cite[Thm 5.2]{hutchings2011cup}.
In \cite{milnor1974characteristic}, the first part is shown for $\xi=TM$ using Poincar√© duality. In \cite{hutchings2011cup}, the first part is concluded from the second using the Lefschetz fixed point theorem.

As a consequence of the theorem, the Euler class vanishes if and only if the Euler characteristic vanishes, and this is equivalent to the Thom class $u$ having a preimage wrt.\ the map $H^{r-1}(TM_0) \to H^r(TM, TM_0)$.

\subsection{Gysin Sequence}\label{subsec:gysin_sequence}
We follow \cite[pp. 438]{hatcher2002algebraic}. We consider fiber bundles with spherical fiber $S^{r-1}\to E\xrightarrow{p} B$. The Gysin sequence is an exact sequence of the form 
\begin{align*}
    \dots \to H^{i-n}(B) \xrightarrow{\cupp e} H^i(B) \xrightarrow{p^*} H^i(E) \to H^{i-n+1}(B)\to \dots
\end{align*}

One can associate to this sphere bundle an $r$-disk bundle using the mapping  cylinder $M_p$ of $p$. The mapping cylinder $M_p$ of a general continuous map is constructed as $M_p = (([0, 1]\times E) \coprod B) / (0, x) \sim p(x)$. Through the mapping cylinder, the map $p$ is factored into a cofibration and a surjective homotopy equivalence $E \injto M_p \surjto B$. Here, $E$ is included via $x\mapsto (1, x)$. 

In the special case where $p$ is the projection of a sphere bundle, the mapping cylinder of the projection map is a disk bundle $D^r\to M_p \to B$ with $E$ as its boundary sphere bundle. Assume for the moment that this bundle is orientable, so a Thom class $u\in H^r(M_p, E)$ exists. This is the case for example if $E$ is orientable. TODO: Why? / Do we need this?

We have the following commutative diagram: 

\begin{tikzcd}
    \dots \rar & H^i(M_p, E) \rar["j^*"] & H^i(M_p) \rar & H^i(E) \rar & H^{i+1}(M_p, E) \rar  &\dots \\
    \dots \rar & H^{i-r}(B) \uar["\Phi"][swap]{\iso}\rar["\cupp e"] & H^i(B)  \uar["p^*"][swap]{\iso} \rar["p^*"] & H^i(E) \uar["\id"]\rar & H^{i-r+1}(B) \uar["\Phi"][swap]{\iso} \rar  &\dots
\end{tikzcd}

Here $\Phi$ is the Thom isomorphism of the disk bundle $M_p\to B$, $e$ is the Euler class of $M_p$ and the vertical $p^*$ is an isomorphism as $M_p$ deformation retracts onto $B$. The square containing the map $\cupp e$ commutes due to the following: since $p^*(e) = j^*(c)$ by the definition of the Euler class, we can compute for $b\in H^{i-r}(B)$ that $j^*\Phi(b) = j^*(p^*(b)\cup u) = p^*(b) \cupp j^*(c) = p^*(b) \cupp p^*(e) = p^*(b\cupp e)$. 

Since the upper sequence is exact, so is the lower sequence.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $S^{r-1} \to E \xrightarrow{p} B$ be a fiber bundle over a paracompact base space, such that the associated disk bundle is orientable, denote by $e\in H^r(B)$ the Euler class of this disk bundle. The \emph{Gysin sequence} is the following exact sequence
    \begin{align*}
        \dots \to H_{i-r+1}(B) \to H_i(E) \xrightarrow{p_*} H_i(B) \xrightarrow{\capp e} H_{i-r}(B) \to \dots
    \end{align*}
    and in cohomology
    \begin{align*}
        \dots \to H^{i-r}(B) \xrightarrow{\cupp e} H^i(B) \xrightarrow{p^*} H^i(E) \to H^{i-r+1}(B)\to \dots
    \end{align*}
    The unlabeled map is $H_{i-r+1}(B) \xrightarrow{\Phi^{-1}} H_{i+1}(M_p, E) \xrightarrow{\partial} H_i(E)$. In the cohomology version, it is $H^i(E) \xrightarrow{\delta} H^{i+1}(M_p, E) \xrightarrow{\Phi^{-1}} H^{i-r+1}(B)$. 
\end{theorem}

We have shown the exactness of the sequence in cohomology, the sequence in homology is analogous. 

One can show that if $E$ is a smooth bundle over a smooth manifold $B$ then the map $H_{i-r+1}(B) \xrightarrow{\Phi^{-1}} H_{i+1}(M_p, E) \xrightarrow{\partial} H_i(E)$ is in fact the umkehr map $\pi_!\colon H_{i-r+1}(B) \to H_i(E)$. 

Recall from \ref{subsec:euler_class} that the Euler class is Poincar√© dual a certain homology class, namely a class obtained by intersecting two sections in $M_p$, so the map $\capp e$ is the same as taking the intersection product with such a homology class. 

\section{Intersection Product and Umkehr Maps for Poincar√© Duality Spaces}\label{sec:intersection_product}

Let $M$ be a smooth closed orientable $m$-dimensional manifold. Then the intersection product on the homology of $M$ is a map
\begin{align*}
    H_*(M) \otimes H_*(M) \to H_{*-m}(M)
\end{align*}
There is also a cohomology version is a map $H^*(M) \otimes H^*(M) \from H^{*-m}(M)$. We define the product using Poincar√© duality and show that there is an equivalent definition via the Thom isomorphism. In the investigation of the intersection product we use umkehr maps: to a map $f\colon M\to N$ between poincar√© duality spaces one can assign an umkehr map $f^!\colon H_*(N)\to H_{*+m-n}(M)$ in homology. The intersection product can be interpreted as the umkehr map associated to the diagonal $M\to M\times M$. 

\subsection{Intersection Product via Poincar√© Duality} \label{subsec:intersection_product_via_pd}

TODO: Maybe use different notation for intersection product vs cap product
\begin{definition}
The intersection product is the Poincar√© dual of the cup product. Thus it is the upper map in the following commutative square, where the vertical maps are given by Poincar√© duality and the lower map is the cup product.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        H_*(M) \otimes H_*(M) \dar["\iso"] \rar & H_{*-m}(M) \dar["\iso"] \\
        H^{m-*}(M)\otimes H^{m-*}(M) \rar["\cup"] &  H^{2m-*}(M)
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
Since under the isomorphism $H_*(M\times M) \iso H_*(M)\otimes H_*(M)$, the cup product corresponds to the diagonal map, one can equivalently use the following diagram
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        H_*(M\times M) \dar["\iso"] \rar & H_{*-m}(M) \dar["\iso"] \\
        H^{2m-*}(M\times M) \rar["\Delta^*"] & H^{2m-*}(M)
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
where the left vertical morphism is the Poincar√© Duality of $M\times M$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The cap product and intersection product are related as follows: assume that $a\in H_i(M)$ and $\alpha\in H^{m-i}(M)$ are Poincar√© dual to each other, so $[M]\capp \alpha = a = [M]\capp a$, then for any $b\in H_j(M)$, we can show 
\begin{align*}
    b\capp a = b\capp \alpha 
\end{align*}
Denote by $\beta$ be the Poincar√© dual of $b$. The Poincar√© dual of  $b\capp a = ([M]\capp \beta) \capp ([M] \capp\alpha)$ is $\beta\cupp\alpha$, hence $b\capp a = [M] \capp (\beta\cupp \alpha) = ([M]\capp \beta) \capp \alpha =  b\capp \alpha$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Umkehr Maps via Poincar√© Duality} \label{subsubsec:umkehr_maps_via_pd}
TODO: Bredon uses lower shrieks for the maps in homology, maybe we should too? 

There is a generalization of the intersection product, where the diagonal map is replaced with any continuous map between Poincar√© duality spaces. 

\begin{definition}
Let $f\colon M\to  N$ be a map of smooth closed oriented manifolds. Then there is a contravariant \emph{umkehr map} on homology which we denote by $f^!\colon H_*(N)\to H_{*+m-n}(M)$ which is defined via Poincar√© duality:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        H_*(N) \dar["\iso"] \rar & H_{*+m-n}(M) \dar["\iso"] \\
        H^{n-*}(N) \rar["f^*"] & H^{n-*}(M)
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The intersection product is a special case, namely the umkehr map of the diagonal $\Delta^!$. The intersection product has a naturality property with respect to such maps, namely
\begin{align*}
    f_*(\alpha) \capp \beta = f_*(\alpha \capp f^!(\beta)).
\end{align*}
One can prove this using the analogous naturality property of the cap product.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
If $(M, \partial M = A\union B)$ and $(N, \partial N = C \union D)$ are as required for Poincar√© duality in \ref{thm:poincare_duality} then a map of pairs $f\colon (M, B) \to (N, D)$ gives rise to a \emph{relative umkehr maps}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        H_*(N, C) \dar["\iso"] \rar & H_{*+m-n}(M, A) \dar["\iso"] \\
        H^{n-*}(N, D) \rar["f^*"] & H^{n-*}(M, B)
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
An example of a relative umkehr map is the Thom isomorphism, as promised in \ref{thm:thom_class_dual}.
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:thom_iso_intersection}
    The Thom isomorphism $H_{*+n}(E, E_0) \xrightarrow{\capp u} H_*(E)\xrightarrow{\pi_*}H_*(B)$ is the umkehr map of the zero section, seen as a map $s\colon (B, \emptyset) \to (DE, SE)$
\end{theorem}
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem} Let $f\colon M\to N$, $a\in H_i(M), b\in H_j(M)$, $\alpha\in H^{m-i}, \beta\in H^{m-j}(M)$, $c\in H_k(M), \gamma\in H_k(M)$, $c'\in H_k(N), \gamma'\in H_{n-k}(N)$. The cap product, cup product, intersection map and umkehr maps satisfy the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\cupp$ is associative and graded commutative, the intersection product is associative and satisfies $a\capp b = (-1)^{(n-i)(n-j)}b\capp a$.
        \item If $a$ is Poincar√© dual to $\alpha$ then $b\capp a = b\capp \alpha$
        \item $f_*(a)\capp \gamma' = f_*(a\capp f^*(\gamma'))$
        \item $f_*(a)\capp c' = f_*(a\capp f^!(c))$
        \item $(a\capp \beta) \capp \gamma = a\capp (\beta\cupp\gamma)$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

TODO: "Proof" via references to previous remarks

\subsection{Intersection product via Tubular neighborhoods} \label{subsubsec:intersection_via_tubular_neighborhoods}
Recall that the Thom isomorphism can be interpreted as an intersection with the zero section of a vector bundle. The intersection product is equivalent to taking the intersection with the diagonal in $M\times M$. To translate between the different settings, we use tubular neighborhoods. 

\begin{construction}
Let $N\subset M\times M$ be a tubular neighborhood of the diagonal, so that $N$ is isomorphic to the normal of the tangent bundle of the diagonal $\Delta(M)\subset M\times M$. Note that the normal bundle is isomorphic to the tangent bundle via $(X, Y)\mapsto (X, -Y)$. Then we have the following sequence of maps
\begin{equation}
\begin{tikzcd}
    H_*(M\times M) \rar & H_*(M\times M, M\times M\setminus \Delta) & \lar["\iso"] H_*(N, N_0) \dar["\iso"] &\ \\
    & & H_*(DM, D_0M) \rar["\pi_*(\cdot \capp u)"] & H_{*-m}(M)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
The second map is an excision isomorphism and the last map is the Thom isomorphism of the tangent bundle of $M$, i.e.\ the cap product with the Thom class $u=u(TM)$. 
\end{construction}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:intersection_product_tubular}
    The intersection product as defined in \ref{subsec:intersection_product_via_pd} is equal to the map defined in \ref{subsubsec:intersection_via_tubular_neighborhoods}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We first show that the intersection product is equal to the following map, which intersects at the diagonal of $M\times M$: 
        \begin{align*}
            H_*(M\times M) \xrightarrow{\capp [\Delta]} H_{*-m}(M\times M) \xrightarrow{p_{1*}} H_{*-m}(M)
        \end{align*}
        The first map intersects with the diagonal, that is the intersection with the diagonal homology class $\Delta_*[M]\in H_n(M\times M)$, where the intersection product is defined via Poincar√© Duality. The second map is the projection to the first factor of the product (the following calculation also shows that one could just as well use the second instead).

        By the naturality property of the intersection product, one has for any $a\in H_*(M\times M)$ that
        \begin{align*}
            p_{1*}(a \capp \Delta_*([M])) &= p_{1*}\Delta_*(\Delta^!(a) \capp [M]) \\
            &= p_{1*}\Delta_*(\Delta^!(a)) = \Delta^!(a)
        \end{align*}
        Since $\Delta^!$ is the intersection product, this shows the first claim.

        \item 
        TODO rename the different u's

        Let $[\Delta]\in H_n(M\times M)$ be the fundamental class of the diagonal and $[\Delta]^*\in H^n(M\times M)$ its Poincar√© dual. Let $u_\Delta^{M\times M}\in H^n(M\times M)$ be the image of $u_\Delta$ under the restriction map $H(M\times M, M\times M\setminus \Delta)\to H^n(M\times M)$. In lemma 4.2 of \cite{hutchings2011cup} it is shown that $u^{M\times M}_\Delta$ is Poincar√© dual to $[\Delta]$.

        Hence the intersection product is equal to $p_{1*}(\cdot \capp u^{M\times M}_\Delta)$. 
        \begin{align*}
            H_*(M\times M) \xrightarrow{\capp u^{M\times M}_\Delta} H_{*-m}(M\times M) \xrightarrow{p_{1*}} H_{*-m}(M)
        \end{align*}
            

        \item We now consider the following diagram, which translates the map from part 2 into the map defined via tubular neighborhoods.  Denote by $u_N\in H_m(N, N_0)$ and $u_{\Delta M}\in H_m(M\times M, M\times M\setminus \Delta M)$ the image of $u$ under the chain of maps $H_m(DM, D_0M) \iso H_m(N, N_0) \iso H_m(M\times M, M\times M\setminus \Delta M)$.
        
        \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            H_*(M\times M) \rar \dar["\capp u_\Delta^{M\times M}"] & H_*(M\times M, M\times M\setminus \Delta) \dar["\capp u_\Delta"] &  \lar["\iso"] H_*(N, N_0) \dar["\capp u_N"] \rar["\iso"] & \dar["\capp u"] H_*(DM, D_0M) \\
            H_{*-m}(M\times M) \rar\dar["p_{1*}"] & H_{*-m}(M\times M) \dar["p_{1*}"] & \lar H_{*-m}(N) \rar \dar["\iso"]& H_{*-m}(DM) \dar["\iso"]\\
            H_{*-m}(M) \rar["="]& H_{*-m}(M) & \lar["="] H_{*-m}(M) \rar["="] & H_{*-m}(M) 
        \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}

        The top squares commute due to the naturality of the cap product. The maps in the bottom squares are all either versions of the diagonal map, identity maps or the projection $H_*(M\times M)\to H_*(M)$, hence commutativity is easy to see. The left vertical maps give the intersection product from step 2 and the composition of the top row and right column give the map defined in \ref{subsubsec:intersection_via_tubular_neighborhoods}.

        In fact, any path from the upper left to the bottom row is the intersection product.

    \end{enumerate}

\section{Slant Product and Fiber Integration}

    \subsection{Cohomology Slant Product}
    This version of the slant product is not currently used in the main part of the thesis and is just here for completeness. (TODO)

    The \emph{cohomology slant product} is a product operation on homology and cohomology. The slant product relates to the cap product similarly to how the cross product relates to the cup product. Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. The (cohomological) slant product is an operation 
    \begin{align*}
        \backslash \colon C^i(X) \otimes C_n(X\times Y) \to C_{n-i}(Y)
    \end{align*}
    Let $\varepsilon \colon C_*(X; R) \otimes C^*(X; R) \to R$ be the standard evaluation map. The slant product is given as 
    \begin{align*}
        C^i(X) \otimes C_n(X\times Y) \to C^i(X) \otimes C_k(X)\otimes C_{n-k}(Y) \to C_{n-i}(Y)
    \end{align*}
    This yields a map in homology
    \begin{align*}
        H^i(X)\otimes H_n(X\times Y) \to H_{n-i}(Y)
    \end{align*}

    \begin{remark}
    Equivalently, one can define the slant product using the cap product as the following map
    \begin{align*}
        C^i(X)\otimes C_n(X\times Y) \xto{p_X^*} C^i(X\times Y) \otimes C_n(X\times Y) \xto{\capp} C_{n-i}(X\times Y) \xto{p_{Y*}} C_{n-i}(Y)
    \end{align*}
    which is analogous to the relation between the cup product and cross product on cohomology $a\times b = p_X^*a \cupp p_Y^* b$. The slant product satisfies analogous properties as the cap product, for example naturality, associativity wrt.\ the cross product, duality ($\langle x\times y, \eta\rangle = \langle x, y\backslash\eta \rangle$). See \cite[VII.11]{dold2012lectures}.
    \end{remark}

    There is a relative version for pairs $(X, A)$ and $(Y, B)$:
    \begin{align*}
        H^i(X, A)\otimes H_n(X\times Y, A\times Y\union X\times B) \to H_{n-i}(Y, B)
    \end{align*}

    \subsection{Homology Slant Product}
    There is another version of the slant product, which is denoted $/$ and is called the \emph{homology slant product}. We follow \cite[chapter 6.1]{spanier1989algebraic}, see there for proofs and details. This slant product is a map
    \begin{align*}
        \slant\colon H^n(X\times Y) \otimes H_i(X) \to H^{n-i}(Y)
    \end{align*}
    This is defined via the composition
    \begin{align*}
        C^n(X\times Y) \otimes C_i(X) \xto{EZ_i} C^{i}(X)\otimes C^{n-i}(Y)\otimes C_i(X) \xto{\varepsilon\otimes \id} C^{n-i}(Y)
    \end{align*}
    It satisfies the following characteristic relation $(c\times c')\slant\alpha = c\langle c', \alpha \rangle$ for $c\in H^*(X), c'\in H^*(Y), \alpha\in H_*(Y)$.

    Again there is a duality relation $$\langle z\slant\xi, \eta\rangle = \langle z, \xi\times \eta\rangle$$ where $z\in H^*(X\times Y), \xi\in H_i(X), \eta\in H_*(Y)$. 

    Given $f\colon X\to X', g\colon Y\to Y'$ and $u\in H^n(X'\times Y'), z\in H_q(Y)$, then in $H^{n-q}(X)$, one has $$((f\times g)^*u)/z = f^*(u/g_*(z)).$$

    There is a relative version 
    \begin{align*}
        \slant\colon H^n((X,A)\times (Y,B))\otimes H_i(X, A) \to H^{n-i}(Y, B)
    \end{align*}

    In a de Rham setting the slant product is given via fiber integration, as is shown in the following subsection. 

    \subsection{Fiber Integration}\label{subsec:fiber_integration}
    
    \paragraph{Fiber integration for vector bundles} Let $p\colon E\to S$ be a smooth rank $r$ oriented vector bundle over a manifold. There is an integration along the fiber map $p_*\colon \Omega^*_{cv}(E) \to \Omega^{*-r}(S)$ of de Rham forms \cite[I.6]{bott1982differential}. Here the first is the space of forms with compact vertical support, one can show that its cohomology $H^*_{cv}(E)$ is isomorphic to the cohomology $H^*(E, E_0)$ where $E_0 = E\setminus S$ is $E$ minus the zero section.

    \paragraph{Fiber integration for bundles with compact fibers} Similarly one can define a fiber integration map for oriented fiber bundles with compact fiber to obtain a map $\pi_*\colon \Omega^*(E) \to \Omega^{*-r}(S)$, where $r$ is the dimension of the fiber. This again descends to a fiber integration map in cohomology 
    \begin{align*}
        \pi_*\colon H^n(E; \R) \to H^{n-r}(S; \R)
    \end{align*}
    
    \paragraph{Fiber integration for cartesian products} In the special case of a cartesian product $B\times F$ of smooth manifolds with orientable fiber, instead of integrating over the entire fiber, one can integrate over a smooth singular chain in the fiber. This yields a fiber integration map 
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{M\times Z_q / M} \colon \Omega^*(B\times F) \to \Omega^{*-q}(B)
    \end{align*}
    The notation is from \cite{hopkins2005quadratic}. TODO: Check for different notation?
    
    We adapt the definition from \cite{bott1982differential} to this context. Let $\sigma\colon \Delta^n\to F$ be a singular simplex. Let $\omega_F$ be an orientation form of the fiber. Then any form on $E$ is locally a sum of two types of forms: those which contain $\pi_F^*(\omega_F)$ as a factor and those that don't. Define the fiber integral as follows
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{M\times\sigma / M} \colon \begin{array}{llll}
             (1) & (\pi_B^*(\phi)) (\pi_F^*(\psi)) h(x, f)  &\mapsto 0, & \psi\in \Omega^k(F), k<\dim F \\
             (2) & (\pi_B^*(\phi)) (\pi_F^*(\omega_F)) h(x, f)  &\mapsto \phi \int_{\Delta^n} \sigma^*(h(x, f) \omega_F) &
        \end{array}
    \end{align*}
    For a general smooth singular chains in place of $\sigma$, one takes a linear combination of these. 

    TODO: Fubini's theorem, Relation to Gysin sequence, Projection Formula, Stokes thm

    Fiber integration and the slant product are related, the following lemma makes this explicit.
    \begin{lemma}
        Let $B, F$ be smooth manifolds and assume that $F$ is closed and oriented. Suppose that $\omega\in \Omega^{p+q}(B\times F)$ is a differential $p+q$-form, which can be regarded as a smooth cochain denoted also by $\omega$. Suppose that $Z_q$ is a smooth $q$-chain in $F$ respectively. Then 
        \begin{align*}
            \omega/[F] = p_{F*}\omega
        \end{align*}
        and more generally
        \begin{align*}
            \omega/Z_q = \int_{B\times Z_q / B} \omega
        \end{align*}
        % \begin{align*}
        %     \langle \omega/Z_q, Z_p \rangle = \langle \omega, Z_q\times Z_p\rangle = \int_{Z_p\times Z_q} = \langle pi_{M*}\omega, Z_q\rangle \omega, \qquad \omega/Z_p = p_{M*} \omega
        % \end{align*}
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $Z_p$ be a smooth $p$-chain in $B$. By the de Rham isomorphism and the properties of fiber integration and the slant product,
    \begin{align*}
        \langle \omega/Z_q, Z_p \rangle = \langle \omega, Z_q\times Z_p\rangle = \int_{Z_p\times Z_q}\omega = \int_{Z_p} \int_{M\times Z_q / M} \omega = \left\langle \int_{M\times Z_q / M}\omega, Z_p\right\rangle
    \end{align*}
    \end{proof}

    TODO: Similar statement for diffeological spaces like $PM, LM$.








\section{String Topology}

\subsection{Loop Product}
The loop product is a product on the homology of the loop space 
\begin{align*}
    H_*(LM)\otimes H_*(LM)\to H_{*-m}(LM)
\end{align*}
Denote by $LM\times_M LM$ the subspace of $LM\times LM$ of pairs $(\gamma, \gamma')$ such that $\gamma(0) = \gamma'(0)$. Such loops can be composed to obtain a new loop, thus we have a map $LM\times_M LM\to LM$. To transform this into a product on $H_*(LM)$, we intersect a homology class in $LM\times LM$ with the space $LM\times_M LM$, which is a codimension $n$ subspace.

\begin{construction}
The loop product is the composition of three maps
\begin{align*}
    H_*(LM)\otimes H_*(LM)\xto{\times} H_{*}(LM\times LM)\xto{} H_{*-m}(LM\times_M LM)\to H_{*-m}(LM)
\end{align*}
where the first is the K√ºnneth isomorphism (we work with coefficients in a field), the second is an intersection map that is to be explained in more detail in the following, and the third is the composition of loops. The main difficulty is the construction of the intersection map.
\end{construction}

There is a pullback diagram

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
    LM\times_M LM \dar["ev"] \rar & LM\times LM\dar["ev\times ev"]\\
    M \rar["\Delta"] & M\times M
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

% To shorten notation, let $\mathcal E \defeq LM\times LM$ and $\mathcal E|_M \defeq LM\times_M LM$. 

% We can define the following zig-zag chain of maps:
% \begin{align*}
%     C_*(\mathcal E)\to C_*(\mathcal E, \mathcal E|_{M\times M\setminus \Delta}) \xfrom{\iso} C_*(\mathcal E|)
% \end{align*}



\paragraph{Pulled back tubular neighborhood} Let $N$ be a tubular neighborhood of the diagonal in $M\times M$, and $N_0 = N\setminus \Delta M$. Recall that the normal bundle of the diagonal bundle is isomorphic to the tangent bundle of the diagonal, so for the tubular neighborhood we have an isomorphism $J\colon TM\iso N$, which maps the zero section to the diagonal. 

We can pull back the tangent bundle along $ev\colon LM\times_M LM$ to obtain the pullback bundle $ev^*(TM)$, which is a rank $m$ bundle with base space $LM\times_M LM$. On the other hand we can pull back the tubular neighborhood and obtain $LM\times LM|_N = (ev\times ev)^{-1}(N)$. \begin{lemma}
    There is a homotopy equivalence $ev^*(TM) \iso LM\times LM|_N$, which maps the zero section to $LM\times_M LM$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Denote by $[0, X]$ the straight line path in $T_{ev(\gamma)}M$ from $0$ to $X$ and by $[X, 0]$ its inverse. Then given $(X, \gamma)\in ev^*(TM)$ with $X\in T_{ev(\gamma)}, \gamma\in LM\times_M LM$, we obtain an element of $LM\times LM|N$ by composing the paths $J([0, X]) \circ \gamma \circ J([X, 0])$. The converse direction is a similar composition of paths.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Pulled back Thom class}

Assume that $M$ is oriented, let $u\in H^m(TM, (TM)_0)$ be the Thom class of $TM$, which is dual to the zero section in the sense of \ref{thm:thom_class_dual}. Taking the pullback along the projection $ev^*(TM)\to TM$, we obtain a class $u_{LM\times_M LM} \in H^m(ev^*(TM), ev^*(TM)_0)$. We interpret this as dual to the zero section of $ev^*(TM)$, so that taking the intersection with $LM\times_M LM$ in $ev^*(TM)$ is the same as capping with $LM\times_M LM$.

% Assume that $M$ is oriented, so it has a fundamental class $[M]\in H_m(M)$, let $u \in H^m(M\times M)$ be the Poincar√© dual in $M\times M$ of the diagonal $\Delta_*[M]\in H_n(M\times M)$. One can check that $u$ is in fact a class in $H^m(M\times M, M\times M\setminus \Delta)$. Taking the intersection product with $\Delta_*[M]$ is the same as taking the cap product with $u$. 

% Let $u_{LM\times_M LM} = (ev\times ev)^*(u)\in H^n(LM\times LM)$, we informally interpret this as dual to $LM\times_M LM = (p\times p)^{-1}(\Delta M)$ in $LM\times LM$, so the cap product with $u$ can be thought of as intersecting with $LM\times_M LM$. 


\begin{construction}
To shorten notation, we write $H_*(X \mid A) = H_*(X, X\setminus A)$. We construct the intersection map as 

\begin{align*}
    H_*(LM\times LM) \to H_*(LM\times LM \mid LM\times_M LM) \xfrom{\iso} H_*(LM\times LM |_N, LM\times LM|_{N_0}) \\ \xto{\iso} H_*(ev^*(TM), (ev^*(TM))_0) \xto{\cap u_{LM\times_M LM}} H_{*-n}(ev^*(TM)) \to H_*(LM\times_M LM)
\end{align*}

Here the second map is an excision map, $(ev^*(TM)_0)$ is the bundle minus the zero section, the third map and fourth map are the Thom isomorphism of the bundle $ev^*(TM)$.

\end{construction}

% Consider the diagrams
% \begin{center}
%     \begin{tikzcd}
%         LM\times LM|_{N_0} \dar \rar & LM\times LM |_N \dar \\
%         LM\times LM \setminus LM\times_M LM \rar & LM\times LM
%     \end{tikzcd}
%     \qquad
%     \begin{tikzcd}
%         N_0 \rar \dar & N \dar \\
%         M\times M\setminus \Delta(M) \rar & M\times M
%     \end{tikzcd}
% \end{center}
%The first diagram is a pullback of the second diagram along $p\times p$. The diagonal is a cofibration: Spaces for which the diagonal is a cofibration are called locally equiconnected, this holds e.g. for cv complexes, in particular for $M$. The pullback of a cofibration is a cofibration, hence the inclusion $LM\times_M LM\to LM\times LM$ is a cofibration, and hence the left diagram is a homotopy pullback diagram. Thus there is an equivalence of cofibers of the horizontal maps, and this gives the claimed isomorphism on homology. 

\subsection{String Bracket and Cobracket}
The main ingredient for the definition of the string bracket and cobracket on the equivariant cohomology of $LM$ are the loop product and coproduct. Thus our definition is no different from the standard definition, except that we have defined the loop product using configuration spaces. In the following we present the standard definition of the string bracket and cobracket.

The main object of string topology is the quotient $LM$ modulo $S^1$, where $S^1$ acts on loops via $\gamma\mapsto \gamma(\cdot + t)$. Note that this action is not free, e.g. on constant loops or loops which are periodic with period smaller $1$. A free action is desirable, so we replace $LM$ with a different space on which $S^1$ acts freely.

\paragraph{Classifying Space and homotopy orbit space} For a topological group $G$ recall that the classifying space $BG$ is the quotient of a weakly contractible space $EG$ by a proper free action of $G$. For the special case $G=S^1$ this is the bundle $S^1\to S^\infty\to \C P^\infty$, where $BG = \C P^\infty$, the direct limit of the complex projective spaces, and $S^\infty = ES^1$ is the direct limit of the unit spheres. $S^\infty$ is contractible. TODO: References, Elaborate on classifying spaces

Using the classifying space, one can construct the homotopy quotient space, which is the "'homotopically correct"` version of the orbit space. Given a space $X$ with a $G$-action, the homotopy quotient is the space $EG\times_G X = EG\times X / G$. 

Consider the $S^1$-bundle $\pi\colon LM\simeq LM\times ES^1\to LM_{S^1} = LM\times_{S^1} ES^1$. We denote by $H^*_{S^1}(LM) = H^*(LM\times_{S^1} ES^1)$ the cohomology of the homotopy quotient of $LM$ by $S^1$. 

TODO: To use the Gysin sequence we need to show that the associated disk bundle is orientable.

\paragraph{The umkehr map of $\pi$} We are interested in the umkehr map in homology of the projection $\pi$. As this is a map with sphere fiber, the umkehr map can be constructed via the Gysin sequence. The Gysin sequence (see subsection \ref{subsec:gysin_sequence}) of this bundle is 
\begin{align*}
    \dots \to H^*(LM)\xrightarrow{\pi^*} H_{S^1}(LM) \to H^{*+2}_{S^1}(LM) \xrightarrow{\pi_!} H^{*+1}(LM) \to \dots
\end{align*}
and there is a similar sequence for reduced cohomology. 

In homology, the umkehr map $\pi^!\colon H^{*+1}(LM)\to H^{*+2}_{S^1}(LM)$ can be thought of as the preimage map, which maps a string to the family of all its possible rotations. TODO: Justify this.

\begin{construction}
    Now the \emph{string bracket} is defined (up to sign) as the composition
\begin{align*}
    \bar H_{S^1}^*(LM) \xto{\pi^*} \bar H^*(LM)\to (\bar H^*(LM) \otimes \bar H^*(LM))[n] \xto{\pi_!\otimes\pi_!} (\bar H^*_{S^1}(LM)\otimes\bar H^*_{S^1}(LM))[n-2]
\end{align*}
% The \emph{string cobracket} is defined (up to sign) as the composition
% \begin{align*}
%     \bar H_{S^n}
% \end{align*}
\end{construction}
% \begin{align*}
%     \bar H^*_{S^1}(LM)\otimes \bar H^*_{S^1}(LM) \xrightarrow{\pi^*\otimes\pi^*} \bar H^*(LM) \otimes \bar H^*(LM) \to 
% \end{align*}



\section{Elements of Homological Algebra}

\subsection{Pullback-Pushout Lemma / Eilenberg Moore Spectral Sequence}\label{subsec:eilenberg_moore}
Consider the following pullback of topological spaces:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
    E\times_B X \arrow[d] \arrow[r] & E \arrow[d]{p} \\
    X \arrow[r] & B
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

The following theorem is stated in \cite{felix2012rational}.
\begin{theorem}
Assume $p$ is a Serre fibration, $E$ is path connected and $X$ and $B$ are simply connected. Let $A_X \leftarrow A_B \rightarrow A_E$ be a rational dgca model for the lower right span in the diagram. Then the homotopy pushout $A_X \otimes_{A_B}^h A_E$ is a dgca model for the pullback $E\times_B X$.
\end{theorem}
For the proof they reference~\cite[Proposition 15.8]{naef2022string}, where this is shown in the case that $A_X$, $A_E$ and $A_B$ are Sullivan models. By homotopy invariance of the homotopy pushout, this then also holds for general dgca models. Note that field coefficients are used here. In \cite{hatcher2004spectral} there is the additional assumption that the cohomology of $E, B, X$ are finitely generated in each dimension. In \cite{ramzi_eilenberg} both the simply connectedness and the vanishing fundamental group are replaced with more general hypotheses.


% We are interested in describing the chain complex of $E\times_B X$ using the chain complexes of the span $X \to B \leftarrow E$. Since homology is a homotopy invariant, it makes sense to consider this as a homotopy pullback; this is the case for example if the vertical arrows are fibrations. The general statement that one might hope for here is that the homotopy pullback commutes with the chain complex functor. This is wrong in general, however it is true under certain connectedness assumptions on the involved spaces. 

% Homotopy limits take a bit of time to describe and we do not go in-depth here. The basic problem is that homotopy equivalent diagrams of e.g.\ spaces or chain complexes generally don't yield homotopy equivalent limits resp.\ colimits. One also cannot work in the homotopy category, where homotopic maps are identified, as this category is known to not have many limits resp.\ colimits. 

% There are two basic ideas to computing homotopy limits. The first is to replace the diagram with a homotopy equivalent version that is somehow general enough that the usual limit construction gives the correct homotopy pushout. An investigation of the properties that make this work leads to the notion of model categories, which are categories equipped with distinguished classes of morphisms, namely weak equivalences, cofibrations and fibrations. See for example~\cite{dwyer1995homotopy} (TODO other references).

% The second idea is to make homotopies between maps, and higher homotopies part of the structure of the category, which leads to the notion of $\infty$-categories~\cite{lurie2009higher},\ \cite{lurie2017higher} (TODO other references) (also known as quasicategories or $(\infty, 1)$-categories). In an $\infty$-category, composition of morphisms is only defined up to homotopy. Much of the language and theorems of regular categories translate to $\infty$-categories. A notion of limits and colimits in $\infty$-categories exists and it agrees with homotopy limits resp.~colimits in the examples. We briefly unpack what this means for pullbacks. Recall that in a normal pullback, to every cone, the pullback assigns a universal arrow to the pullback cone, which makes certain triangles commute. In homotopy, these triangles commute only up to homotopy and we consider homotopies part of the data. Hence a cone consists not only of natural morphisms, but also of explicit homotopies that make the relevant triangles commute up to homotopy. The pullback is a universal cone and the universal property assigns to each cone not only a universal arrow, but also homotopies which make the relevant diagrams commute. As this assignment depends on the cone, it depends not only on the morphisms of the cone, but also on the homotopies. This assignment is no longer unique, instead one requires that the space of suitable data is contractible, which is where higher homotopies appear. 

There is a homology version of the theorem, this is the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence~\cite{eilenberg1966homology} of homology. Here any space should have the homotopy type of a cw complex.

\begin{theorem}
    Consider a pullback of topological spaces as above, again with $p$ a fibration, $B$ pathwise connected and simply connected. Then for any commutative ring $K$, the natural map
    \begin{align*}
        C_*(E)\boxtimes_{C_*(B)}^h C_*(X) \to C_*(E\times_B X)
    \end{align*}
    is a quasi-isomorphism.
\end{theorem}

% Note that there is an equivalent pullback diagram
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tikzcd}
%     E\times_B X \arrow[d] \arrow[r] & B \arrow[d] \\
%     E\times X \arrow[r] & B \times B
% \end{tikzcd}
% \end{center}
% which identifies the homotopy fiber of the vertical maps, hence there is a homotopy fiber sequence $\Omega B \to E\times_B X \to E\times X$, i.e. the homotopy fiber of $E\times_B X \to E\times X$ is the loop space $\Omega B$.

\subsection{Two sided Bar Construction}\label{subseq:bar_construction}
Let $A$ be a differential graded algebra, $M$ a right dg $A$ module and $N$ a left $A$ dg module. Denote by $B(M, A, N)$ the two sided bar construction, namely 
\begin{align*}
    B(M, A, N) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} M\otimes A[1]^{\otimes n} \otimes N
\end{align*}
We write $[a_1|\dots|a_n]\in A[1]^{\otimes n}$ for a homogeneous element of the tensor algebra and accordingly $m[a_1|\dots|a_n]n$ for a generator of $M\otimes \bar A[1]^{\otimes n}\otimes N$.


$B(M, A, N)$ is a chain complex with differential 
\begin{align*}d(m[a_1|\dots|a_n]n) =& m [a_1|\dots|a_n]n \pm \sum_i m[a_1|\dots|a_i a_{i+1}| \dots|a_n]n \pm m[a_1|\dots|a_n] n\\& + dm[a_1|\dots|a_n]m \pm \sum_i m[a_1|\dots|a_n]n \pm m[a_1|\dots|d a_n]n \pm m[a_1|\dots|a_n]dn.
\end{align*}
TODO: Look up signs


There is a normalized version of the two sided bar construction:
\begin{align*}
    B'(M, A, N) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} M\otimes \bar A[1]^{\otimes n}\otimes N
\end{align*}
where $\bar A$ is given by $\bar A_0 = A_0/(1)$. This is equipped with a differential using the same formula as above.

Note: Chen uses a different definition of $\bar A$, there $A_0 = 0$ and $A_1 = A_1 / d(A_0)$.

\begin{lemma}
    The canonical map $B(M, A, N)\to B'(M, A, N)$ induces a quasi-isomorphism of chain complexes.
\end{lemma}
TODO Proof.

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:bar_resolution}
    The canonical map $B(A, A, A)\to A$ given by the product map $A\otimes A\to A$ for $n=0$ and $0$ otherwise, is a a quasi-isomorphism of chain complexes.

    More generally, the map $B(M,A,N)\to M\otimes_A N$ is a quasi-isomorphism of chain complexes under certain conditions.
\end{lemma}
TODO: Proof or reference

If $A$ is (graded) commutative, then $B(A, A, A)$ is a (graded) commutative dg algebra with the shuffle product (TODO: details. see \cite[4.1]{chen1973iterated}). Up to signs, this is defined as

\begin{align*}
    a[a_1|\dots|a_n]a' \shuffle b[a_{n+1}|\dots|a_{n+m}]b' = \sum_{\sigma\in\mathrm{Sh}(n, m)}
\end{align*}

There is also a deconcatenation coproduct in the category of $A$-bimodules on $B(A, A, A)$, i.e. a map $B(A, A, A)\to B(A, A, A)\to B(A, A, A)\otimes_A B(A, A, A)$. This can be defined as 
$$\alpha = \alpha(\alpha_1|\dots|\alpha_n)\alpha' \mapsto \sum_i\alpha(\alpha_1|\dots|\alpha_i) 1 (\alpha_{i+1}|\dots|\alpha_n)\alpha'$$
This comultiplication has a counit given by the multiplication map $\varepsilon \colon B(A, A, A)\to A$. This counit map is a quasi-isomorphism (TODO: Citation needed).







\section{Homotopy Pushouts of Topological Spaces}

TODO: Talk about defs of Fibrations, Cofibrations in Top.

In this section we follow \cite[1.2]{may2011more}
\begin{definition}
    Let $X\xleftarrow{f}W\xrightarrow{g}Y$ be given. The double mapping cylinder of $f, g$ is the quotient space
    \begin{align*}
        M(f, g) = \frac{X\coprod(W\times I)\coprod Y}{f(w)\sim (w,0)\quad (w, 1)\sim g(w)}
    \end{align*}
    There are obvious inclusion maps $i_X\colon X\to M(f, g), i_Y\colon Y\to M(f, g)$. There is a canonical homotopy $\psi=\psi_{f, g}\colon i_xf\simeq i_Yg$ given by $\psi_t(w) = (w, t)$ for $w\in W, t\in I$. 
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=.2cm, row sep=.2cm]
            W \arrow[rr,"g"]\arrow[dd,"f"] && Y \arrow[dd, "i_Y"] \\

            X \arrow[rr, "i_X"] && M(f, g)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}
    We will call this square the standard homotopy pushout of $f$ and $g$.
\end{definition}

Suppose we are given another square with homotopy
\begin{equation}\label{diag:square_with_homotopy}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=.2cm, row sep=.2cm]
        W \arrow[rr,"g"]\arrow[dd,"f"] && Y \arrow[dd, "k"] \\
        & \xRightarrow{F} & \\
        X \arrow[rr, "h"] && Z
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
then we get a comparison map 
\begin{align*}
    &\theta_F\colon M(f,g)\to Z \\
    &\theta_F(x) = h(x), \quad \theta_F(y) = k(y), \quad \theta_F(w, t) = F(w, t)
\end{align*}
This fits into a diagram
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    W \ar[r, "g"] \ar[d, "f"]  &  Y \ar[d, "i_Y"] \ar[ddr, bend left, "k"]  & \\
    X \ar[r, "i_X"] \ar[drr, bend right, "h"]  &  M(f, g) \ar[dr, "\theta_F"]  &  \\
    &  &  Z
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
and we have the following equations
\begin{align*}
    \theta_F \psi = F, \quad \theta_F i_X = h, \quad \theta_F i_Y = k
\end{align*}
Note that the first equation is an equation of homotopies and is not pictured in the diagram. 

% \begin{definition}
%     A \emph{homotopy pushout} of topological spaces $X\xleftarrow{f}W\xrightarrow{g}Y$ is a square with homotopy 
%     \begin{equation}
%         \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=.2cm, row sep=.2cm]
%             W \arrow[rr,"g"]\arrow[dd,"f"] && Y \arrow[dd, "k'"] \\
%             & \xRightarrow{F'} & \\
%             X \arrow[rr, "h'"] && Z'
%         \end{tikzcd}
%     \end{equation}
%     such that for any other square with homotopy as in \ref{diag:square_with_homotopy}, there exists is a map $\theta_F\colon Z'\to Z$ such that $ \theta_F F' = F, \quad \theta_F h' = h, \quad \theta_F k' = k$, moreover the subspace of $\theta_F$ satisfying these equations in $\Hom(W\times I, Z)$ is contractible.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{remark}
% If one unwraps the standard definition of pushouts of $(\infty, 1)$-categories in the $(\infty, 1)$-category of topological spaces, one obtains a slightly different universal property, notably the equations are required to hold only up to homotopy. The version of the definition given above is slightly friendlier for explicit computation. In the following we show that our definition is computed by the standard homotopy pushout and that it is homotopy invariant, which shows that it is the right notion. 
% \end{remark}

% \begin{theorem}
%     \begin{enumerate}
%     \item 
%     \item Any two homotopy pushouts over $X\xleftarrow{f}W\xrightarrow{g}Y$ are canonically homotopy equivalent.
%     \item In particular, a square with homotopy as in \ref{diag:square_with_homotopy} is a homotopy pushout if and only if the natural map $\theta_F\colon F\to Z$ is a homotopy equivalence. 
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}
    Consider the diagram

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
        X \dar& \lar["f"] \dar A \rar["g"] & Y\dar \\
        X' & \lar["f'"] A' \rar["g'"] & Y'
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume that in the diagram 
    both $f$ and $f'$ are cofibrations. If all the vertical maps are homotopy equivalences, then so is the induced map of their pushouts (as topological spaces) $X\coprod_A Y \to X'\coprod_{A'} Y'$.
    \item If $f$ is a cofibration, then the natural quotient map $M(f,g)\to X\coprod_A Y$ is a homotopy equivalence.
    \item If in the diagram, the vertical maps are homotopy equivalences, then $M(f, g)$ and $M(f', g')$ are homotopy equivalent through the induced map.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
This is 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 in May-Ponto. The second part follows from the first by noting that $M(f, g)$ is the pushout of the maps $A\to Mf$ and $A\to Y$ and we have a homotopy equivalence $Mf \to X$. The third follows from the second.

A dual version of the theorem holds for homotopy pullbacks with fibrations instead of cofibrations.

\begin{remark}
    The homotopy pushout of a map $f\colon A\to B$ together with the canonical map $A\to *$ where $*$ is the one point space is called the homotopy cofiber of $f$. By the preceding theorem, if $f$ is a cofibration, then the cofiber is homotopy equivalent to the quotient $B/A$.
\end{remark}

\section{Elements of Model Categories}
\subsection{Homotopy Pushouts}
We follow \cite[A.2.4]{lurie2009higher}. 
Let $\cat M$ be a model category.

Consider diagrams in $\cat M$ of the form $X \xfrom{f} A \xto{g} Y$. The pushout $X\coprod_A Y$ of such a diagram is in general poorly behaved in the sense that a map of such diagrams 

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    X \dar& \lar["f"] \dar A \rar["g"] & Y\dar \\
    X' & \lar["f'"] A' \rar["g'"] & Y'
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

need not induce a weak equivalence $X\coprod_A Y \to X'\coprod_{A'} Y'$ even if the vertical maps individually are weak equivalences. To correct this, it is convenient to introduce the left derived functor of the pushout. 
\begin{definition}
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item A diagram 
    $$X \xfrom{f} A \xto{g} Y$$
    is called cofibrant if $A$ is cofibrant and $f$ and $g$ are cofibrations (and hence $X$ and $Y$ are also cofibrant). 
    \item A \emph{cofibrant replacement} of $X \xfrom{f} A \xto{g} Y$ is a diagram of the form 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
        X' \dar& \lar["f'"] \dar A' \rar["g'"] & Y'\dar \\
        X & \lar["f"] A \rar["g"] & Y
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    where the upper row is cofibrant and the vertical arrows are weak equivalences.

    \item The \emph{homotopy pushout} of the diagram 
    $$X \xfrom{f} A \xto{g} Y$$
    is defined to be the pushout $X'\coprod_{A'} Y'$ where we have chosen a cofibrant replacement of $X \xfrom{f} A \xto{g} Y$.
    \item More generally, a diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            A \dar \rar & X \dar \\
            Y \rar & M
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    is called a homotopy pushout square if the composite $X'\coprod_{A'} Y' \to X\coprod_A Y\to M$ is a weak equivalence for some cofibrant replacement.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We write $X\coprod^h_A Y$ for a homotopy pushout $M$ as in (4).
One can show that a cofibrant replacement as required in (2) always exists and that the pushout depends on the choice of diagram only up to weak equivalence. Similarly one can show that the condition in (3) is independent of the choice of cofibrant replacement.

In practice, one can use weaker conditions than in the definition of the cofibrant replacement:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:homotopy_pushout_sufficient}
    Consider a pushout diagram in $\cat M$
    
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            A \dar["i"] \rar["j"] & X \dar \\
            Y \rar & M
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

    This diagram is also a homotopy pushout if either of the following conditions is satisfied:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The objects $Y$ and $A$ are cofibrant and $j$ is a cofibration.
        \item The map $j$ is a cofibration and $\cat M$ is left proper.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We recall basic facts of left and right proper model categories in the following section. Most of the model categories we work with are proper. TODO: Link to subsecs

\begin{remark}
The theory of homotopy pullbacks is completely analogous, where one uses fibrant replacements instead of cofibrant replacements. 
\end{remark}

% \begin{remark}
%     There is a more general theory for homotopy limits and colimits of diagrams indexed by a more general category $I$. For this, one attempts to equip the functor category $\cat M^I$ with the structure of a model category and define derived functors between model categories. The homotopy colimit functor is then the derived functor of the functor $\colim \cat M^I\to \cat M$ and it can again be computed via cofibrant replacement in the model category $\cat M^I$. 
%     In the presentation above, the definitions have been unwrapped for the special case $I=*\from *\to *$.
% \end{remark}

\subsection{Left and right proper model categories}
We are interested in left and right proper model categories due to \ref{thm:homotopy_pushout_sufficient}. We state results from \cite[15.4]{may2011more}.

\begin{definition}
    A model category $\cat M$ is left proper if the pushout of a weak equivalence along a cofibration is a weak equivalence. $\cat M$ is right proper if the pullback of a weak equivalence along a fibration is again a weak equivalence. $\cat M$ is proper if it is both left and right proper.
\end{definition}

For example, the projective model structure on connective chain complexes is a proper model category. TODO: More examples, references.

\begin{proposition}
    If every object of $\cat M$ is cofibrant then $\cat M$ is left proper. If every object of $\cat M$ is fibrant then $\cat M$ is right proper.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}
    $\cat M$ is left proper if and only if the left gluing lemma holds: For any diagram as below, if $f$ and $f'$ are cofibrations and the vertical maps are weak equivalences, then the induced map of pushouts $X\coprod_A Y\to X'\coprod_{A'} Y'$ is a weak equivalence.

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
        X \dar& \lar["f"] \dar A \rar["g"] & Y\dar \\
        X' & \lar["f'"] A' \rar["g'"] & Y
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}


    $\cat M$ is right proper if and only if the right gluing lemma holds, which is stated dually.
\end{theorem}

% \subsection{Derived Functors}
% Let $\cat M$ be a model category, $\cat C$ a category and $\phi\colon\cat M\to\cat C$ a functor. 
% \begin{definition}\label{def:left_derived}
%     A \emph{left derived} functor of $\phi$ is a functor $\mathds L\phi \colon \Ho\cat M\to \cat C$ together with a natural transformation $\varepsilon\colon\mathds L \phi  \comp \gamma\nto \phi \colon \cat M\to \cat C$ such that the pair $(\mathds L, \phi)$ is universal wrt.\ such pairs, in the sense that for any other pair $(G, \zeta)$ where $G\colon \Ho\cat M\to\cat C$ is a functor and $\zeta\colon G\gamma \to \phi$ is a natural transformation, there exists a unique natural transformation $\theta\colon G\nto \mathds L \phi\colon \cat M\to \cat C$ such that $\zeta = \varepsilon(\theta\comp\gamma)$. 
    
%     A \emph{right derived} functor $\mathds R\phi$ of $\phi$ is defined dually in the sense that now $\varepsilon$ is a natural transformation $\phi\nto\mathds \phi\comp\gamma\colon \cat M\to \cat C$.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}
%     Let $\cat M$ be a model category. A cofibrant approximation of an object $X$ in $\cat M$ is a weak equivalence $\tilde X\to X$ such that $\tilde X$ is cofibrant.
%     A cofibrant approximation of a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ in $\cat M$ is a morphism $\tilde g\colon \tilde X\to\tilde Y$ where $i_X\colon \tilde X\to X$ is a cofibrant approximation of $X$, $i_Y\colon \tilde Y\to Y$ is a cofibrant approximation of $Y$ and $i_Y\tilde g = gi_X$.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{theorem}
%     If $\phi$ takes trivial cofibrations between cofibrant objects in $\cat M$ to isomorphisms in $\cat C$ then the left derived functor $\mathds L\phi$ exists. Moreover, for any cofibrant object of $\cat M$, the natural map $\mathds L \phi X \to FX$ is an isomorphism.
% \end{theorem}

% Consider the situation where $\cat M$ and $\cat N$ are model categories and $\phi\colon \cat M \to \cat N$ is a functor.
% \begin{definition}\label{def:total_left_derived}
%     A \emph{total left derived functor} of $\phi$ is a left derived functor of the composition $\cat M\to\cat N\to\Ho\cat N$. Thus a total left derived functor is a functor $\cat L\phi\colon \Ho\cat M\to\Ho\cat N$ together with a natural transformation $\varepsilon\colon\mathds L \phi\comp \gamma_{\cat M}\nto \gamma_{\cat N} \comp \phi\colon \Ho \cat M\to \cat N$, such that the pair $(\mathds L, \varepsilon)$ is universal as in \ref{def:left_derived}.
% \end{definition}
% \begin{theorem}
%     If $\phi$ takes trivial cofibrations between cofibrant objects in $\cat M$ to weak equivalences in $\cat N$, then the total left derived functor $\mathds L\phi\colon\Ho \cat M\to\cat N$ exists. 
% \end{theorem}


\subsection{Homotopical Categories}

To define a homotopy colimit functor, one would like to equip the category $\cat M^I$ with a model structure, for any model category $\cat M$ and an arbitrary category $I$. This is not possible in general, though it is possible for example by adding the requirement that $\cat M$ is a combinatorial model category or that $I$ is a Reedy category. The notion of homotopical category is weaker than model categories, but it allows a theory of derived functors. We follow \cite[2.1 and 2.2]{riehl_2014}.

\begin{definition}
    A homotopical category $\cat M$ is a category with a distinguished set $\cat W$ of maps (called \emph{weak equivalences}) such that 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\cat W$ contains all the identity maps in $\cat M$
        \item $\cat W$ has the two out of six property that, for any three composable maps $r, s, t$ in $\cat M$, for which the compositions $sr$ and $ts$ exist and are in $\cat W$, the four maps $r, s, t$ and $tsr$ are also in $\cat W$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
The definition implies that \begin{enumerate}\item $\cat W$ contains all isomorphisms in $\cat M$ and that \item $\cat W$ has the two out of three property: for any composable maps $r$ and $s$ in $\cat M$, if any of the two morphisms $r$, $s$ and $sr$ is in $\cat W$, then so is the third.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
Any model category gives rise to a homotopical category with the same weak equivalences. Any category has the structure of a homotopical category by taking only the isomorphisms as the weak equivalences. If no other homotopical category structure is canonically available, we use this. 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
Given two homotopical categories $\cat M, \cat N$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A functor $\cat M\to\cat N$ is called \emph{homotopical} if it preserves weak equivalences
    \item A natural transformation between two functors $\cat M\to \cat N$ is called a \emph{natural weak equivalence} if each morphism is a weak equivalence in $\cat N$
    \item Two functors $\cat M\to \cat N$ are called \emph{naturally weakly equivalent} if they can be connected by a zigzag of natural weak equivalences.
    \item A homotopical functor $f\colon\cat M\to \cat N$ is called a homotopical equivalence of homotopical categories if there exists a homotopical functor $f'\colon\cat N\to\cat M$ such that the compositions $ff'$ and $f'f$ are naturally weakly equivalent to the identity functors $\id_{\cat M}$ resp.\ $\id_{\cat N}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    The homotopy category $\Ho\cat M$ is the formal localization of $\cat M$ at the weak equivalences $\cat W$. Hence it is a category $\Ho\cat M$ together with a functor $\gamma_{\cat M}\colon \cat M\to \Ho \cat M$ which maps the weak equivalences to isomorphisms, such that for any other functor $F\colon\cat M\to \cat D$ which maps weak equivalences to isomorphisms, there exists a unique functor $\bar F\colon \Ho\cat M\to \cat D$ such that $ \bar F \gamma_{\cat M} = F$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    The homotopy category of a homotopical category can be constructed as follows: The objects are the same as the objects of $\cat M$, the hom-set $\Ho\cat M(X, Y)$ consists of equivalence classes of zigzags in $\cat M$ from $X$ to $Y$ in which backwards maps are weak equivalences, by the weakest equivalence relation which makes the following identifications
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item identity maps can be omitted
        \item adjacent maps can be replaced by their composition
        \item two adjacent maps which are identical but going in opposite directions may be omitted.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
    One can often find a description of the localization where the zigzags of arbitrary length can be replaced by zigzags of fixed length. For a commutative square 

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            X \dar\rar &Y \dar\\
            Z \rar & W
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

    where the vertical maps are weak equivalences, one can replace $Z \to Y\from Y$ with $Z\from W\to X$ inside a zigzag. Thus if one can always find such squares then one can iteratively shorten any zigzag. An example of this is 3-arrow calculus \cite[Section 36]{dwyer2004homotopy}. 
\end{remark}

\subsection{Derived Functors of homotopical categories}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{total left derived functor} $\mathbf LF$ of a functor $F\colon\cat M\to\cat N$ between homotopical categories $\cat M$ and $\cat N$ is a right Kan extension $\Ran_{\gamma_{\cat M}}\gamma_{\cat N} F$
    
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \cat M\dar["\gamma_{\cat M}"] \rar["F"] \drar[phantom, "\nto"] &\cat N \dar["\gamma_{\cat N}"]\\
            \Ho\cat M\rar["\mathbf LF"] & \Ho\cat N
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

    This means the left derived functor is a pair $(\mathbf LF, \epsilon)$ of a functor $\mathbf LF \colon\Ho \cat M\to \Ho\cat N$ and a natural transformation $\epsilon\colon \mathbf LF\gamma_{\cat M}\nto \gamma_{\cat N} F\colon \cat M\to \Ho\cat N$, such for any other pair $(G, \phi)$ of a functor $G\colon \cat M\to\Ho\cat N$ and $\phi\colon G\gamma_{\cat M} \nto \gamma_{\cat N} F \colon \cat M\to \Ho\cat N$, there exists a unique natural transformation $\theta\colon G\nto\mathbf LF$ such that $\phi = \epsilon(\theta\comp\gamma_{\cat M})$.
\end{definition}

By the universal property of $\Ho\cat M$, the left derived functor $\mathbf LF$ is equivalently a homotopical functor $\cat M\to \Ho \cat N$, which is often called the left derived functor of $F$. Here this terminology is reserved for a lift of $\mathbf LF$ along $\gamma_{\cat N}$.

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{left derived functor} of $F\colon\cat M\to\cat N$ is a homotopical functor $\mathds LF\colon \cat M\to\cat N$ equipped with a natural transformation $\lambda\colon \mathds LF\nto F$ such that $(\gamma_{\cat N} \mathbf LM, \gamma_{\cat N} \lambda)$ is a total left derived functor of $F$ (where $\gamma_{\cat N}\lambda\colon\gamma_{\cat N}\mathds LF\nto \gamma_{\cat N} F$). 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Derived Functors via Deformations}

\begin{definition} A \emph{left deformation} of a homotopical category $\cat M$ is a pair $(Q, q)$ of a homotopical functor $Q\colon \cat M\to \cat M$ and a natural weak equivalence $q\colon Q\to \id_{\cat M}$. 
    
A \emph{left deformation} of a functor $\cat M\to \cat N$ of homotopical categories consists of a left deformation $(Q, q)$ for $\cat M$ together with a category $\cat M_Q$ which is a full subcategory of $\cat M$ containing the image of $Q$, such that $F$ is homotopical on $M_Q$. $M_Q$ is called the category of cofibrant objects. If $F$ admits a left deformation, we say that $F$ is \emph{left deformable}.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Ken Brown's Lemma]
    Let $\cat M$ and $\cat N$ be model categories. Then any left Quillen functor $F\colon \cat M\to \cat N$ (i.e.\ a left adjoint functor that preserves cofibrations and trivial cofibrations) preserves weak equivalences between cofibrant objects.
\end{lemma}
This means that if $\cat M$ admits a functorial cofibrant replacement, then $F$ is left deformable with respect to the subcategory of cofibrant objects of $\cat M$.

\begin{theorem}
    If $F\colon \cat M\to\cat N$ has a left deformation $q\colon Q\nto \id$, then $\mathds LF = FQ$ is a left derived functor of $F$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}
    Let $F\colon \cat M\to\cat N$ and $G\colon \cat N\to\cat P$ be functors of homotopical categories with specified left deformations $(Q, q)$ and $(Q', q')$ and subcategories of cofibrant objects $\cat M_{Q}$, $\cat N_{Q'}$, such that $F$ restricts to a homotopical functor $\cat M_F\to\cat N_G$. Then there are natural weak equivalences
\begin{align*}
    \mathds LG \mathds LF = GQ' FQ \xnto{Gq'} GFQ = \mathds L(GF)\qquad \mathds L\id_{\cat M} = Q \xnto{q} \id_{\cat M}
\end{align*}
that descend to natural isomorphisms $\mathbf LG \mathbf LF\iso\mathbf L(GF)$ and $\mathbf L \id_{\cat M} \iso \id_{\Ho\cat M}$. 
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Cofibrantly generated model categories and the projective model structure}
We follow \cite[Chapter 11]{hirschhorn2003model}.
A cofibrantly generated model category is a category that has two sets of cofibrations and trivial cofibrations that satisfy two conditions: they are in some sense small, and they generate all cofibrations resp. trivial cofibrations via lifting properties. 

Cofibrantly generated model categories allow the construction of the projective model structure on the functor category $\cat M^{\cat C}$. We require a model structure on this functor category to consider homotopy colimits. 

Recall that the fibrations in a model category $\cat M$ are the maps with the right lifting property with respect to all trivial cofibrations. Similarly the trivial fibrations are the maps with the right lifting property with respect to all cofibrations. The weak equivalences are the maps that can be written as compositions of a trivial cofibration and a trivial fibration. Hence for example the cofibrations and trivial cofibrations entirely determine the model category. 

\begin{definition}
     If $\cat M$ is a category and $I$ is a set of maps in $\cat C$, then we say that \emph{$I$ permits the small object argument} if the domains of the elements of $I$ are small relative\footnote{We do not define this notion of smallness here, see \cite[Def. 10.4.1 and 10.5.8]{hirschhorn2003model}.} to $I$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    Let $\cat C$ be a category and $I$ a set of maps in $\cat C$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The category of \emph{$I$-injectives} is the subcategory of maps that have the right lifting property with respect to every element of $I$.
        \item The subcategory of \emph{$I$-cofibrations} is the subcategory of maps that have the left lifting property with respect to every $I$-injective. 
        \item If $\cat C$ is closed under small colimits and $I$ is a set of maps in $\cat C$, then a \emph{relative $I$-cell complex} is a map in $\cat C$ that can be constructed as a transfinite composition \footnote{We do not define transfinite composition here, see \cite[10.2.1]{hirschhorn2003model}.} of pushouts of elements of $I$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Every relative $I$-cell complex is an $I$-cofibration. 
\begin{theorem}
    If $\cat C$ is a cocomplete category and $I$ is a set of maps in $\cat C$ that permits the small object argument, then there is a functorial factorization of every map in $\cat C$ into a relative $I$-cell complex followed by an $I$-injective map.

\begin{definition}[{\cite[11.1.2]{hirschhorn2003model}}]
    A \emph{cofibrantly generated model category} is a model category $\cat M$ such that 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item there exists a set $I$ of maps (called a set of \emph{generating cofibrations}) that permits the small object argument and such that a map is a trivial fibration if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to every element of $I$ and
        \item there exists a set $J$ of maps (called a set of \emph{generating trivial cofibrations}) that permits the small object argument and such that a map is a fibration if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to every element of $J$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[11.2.1]{hirschhorn2003model}}]
    Let $\cat M$ be a cofibrantly generated model category with generating cofibrations $I$ and generating trivial cofibrations $J$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The class of cofibrations of $\cat M$ equals the class of retracts of relative $I$-cell complexes which equals the class of $I$-cofibrations.
        \item The class of trivial fibrations equals the class of $I$-injectives.
        \item The class of trivial cofibrations equals the class of retracts of relative $J$-cell complexes, which equals the class of $J$-cofibrations
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[11.3.1]{hirschhorn2003model}}]
    Let $\cat M$ be a category that is closed under small limits and colimits and let $W$ be a class of maps in $\cat M$ that is closed under retracts and satisfied the two out of three axiom. If $I$ and $J$ are sets of maps in $\cat M$ such that 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item both $I$ and $J$ permit the small object argument
        \item every $J$-cofibration is both an $I$-cofibration and an element of $W$,
        \item every $I$-injective is both a $J$-injective and an element of $W$
        \item one of the following two conditions holds:
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item a map that is both an $I$-cofibration and na element of $W$ is a $J$-cofibration, or
            \item a map that is both a $J$-injective and an element of $W$ is an $I$-injective,
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    then there is a cofibrantly generated model category structure on $\cat M$ in which $W$ is the class of weak equivalences, $I$ is a set of generating cofibrations and $J$ is a set of generating trivial cofibrations. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[11.6.1]{hirschhorn2003model}}]
    If $\cat C$ is a small category and $\cat M$ is a cofibrantly generated model category with generating cofibrations $I$ and generating trivial cofibrations $J$, then the category $\cat M^{\cat C}$ is a cofibrantly generated model category. In this model category structure, a map $X\to Y$ is 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a weak equivalence if $X_\alpha \to Y\alpha$ is a weak equivalence in $\cat M$ for every object $\alpha\in\cat C$,
        \item a fibration if $X_\alpha\to Y_\alpha$ is a fibration in $\cat M$ for every object $\alpha$ of $\cat C$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
A model structure on $\cat M^{\cat C}$ with weak equivalences and fibrations as above is called the projective model structure on $\cat M^{\cat C}$. Thus the theorem states that if $\cat M$ is cofibrantly generated, the projective model structure on $\cat M^{\cat C}$ exists. 

% We have natural transformations \begin{align*}
%     \epsilon_F\colon \mathds L F \gamma_M \nto \gamma_N F, \quad \epsilon_G\colon \mathds L G \gamma_N \nto \gamma_P G\quad \text{and}\quad \epsilon_{GF}\colon\mathds L (GF) \gamma_{M} \nto \gamma_{P} GF
% \end{align*} 
% The transformations $\epsilon_F$ and $\epsilon_G$ can be composed as $$\mathds L G\mathds L F \gamma_M \xnto{\mathds L G \epsilon_F} \mathds L G \gamma_N F \xnto{\epsilon_G F} \gamma_P GF.$$ By the universal property of $\mathds L(G\comp F)$, there is a natural transformation $\theta\colon\mathds L G\comp\mathds L F \nto \mathds L(G\comp F) \colon \Ho\cat M\to\Ho\cat P$, such that $\epsilon_{GF}(\theta\comp\gamma_M) = \mathds L G \epsilon_F\comp\epsilon_G F$.

\subsection{Homotopy Colimits}
We follow \cite[Chapter 5-6]{riehl_2014} and \cite[Section 19-21]{dwyer2004homotopy}
\begin{definition}
    Let $\cat D$ be a category and $\cat M$ a category with all $\cat D$-colimits. A homotopy $\cat D$-colimit functor is a a left derived functor of a fixed left adjoint 
    $$\colim^{\cat D}\colon \cat M^{\cat D}\to \cat M$$
    of the constant diagram functor $\cat M\to\cat M^{\cat D}$.
\end{definition}
This makes the homotopy $\cat D$-colimit homotopically unique in the sense that the category of such objects is equivalent through a homotopical equivalence to the single-object category $*$.

% \begin{definition} Combinatorial Model Category
% \end{definition}

% \begin{theorem}
%     Let $\cat M$ be a model category that admits a functorial cofibrant replacement and $\cat D$ a category. Then a homotopy $\cat D$-colimit functor exists. 
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%     Let $Q\colon \cat M\to \cat M_c$ and $q\colon Q\to\id_{\cat M}$ be a functorial cofibrant replacement and hence a left deformation of $\cat M$. Then $Q^{\cat D}\colon \cat M^D\to\cat M_c^{\cat D}$ and $q\colon Q^{\cat D}\to\id_{\cat M^{\cat D}}$ is a left deformation of $\cat M^{\cat D}$. We need to show that this is a left deformation of $\colim\colon\cat M^{\cat D}\to\cat M$. Hence we need to show that $\colim$ maps homotopy equivalent functors in $\cat M_c^{\cat D}$ to homotopy equivalent colimits. 

%     Let $X, Y\colon \cat D\to\cat M_c$ and $f\colon X\nto Y$ an objectwise weak equivalence. For each $i\in \cat C$ consider the map $f_i\colon X_i\to Y_i$. We can factor the coproduct map $f\coprod\id_{Y_i} \colon X_i\coprod Y_i\to Y_i$ as a composite $X_i\coprod Y_i\xto{q_i} C_i \xto{p_i} Y_i$ such that $q_i$ is a cofibration and $p_i$ is an acyclic fibration. Since $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are cofibrant, the inclusions $i_X\colon X_i\to X_i\coprod Y_i$ and $i_Y\colon Y_i\to X_i\coprod Y_i$ are cofibrations, hence the composite maps $q_i i_X\colon X_i\to C_i$ and $q_i i_Y Y_i\to C_i$ are cofibrations. 
% \end{proof}

\subsection{Quillen Adjunctions}
The following is from \cite[16.2]{may2011more}.

\begin{definition}
Let $F\colon \cat M\to \cat N$ and $U\colon \cat N\to\cat M$ be left and right adjoint functors between model categories. The pair $(F, U)$ is a \emph{Quillen adjunction} if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $F$ preserves cofibrations and $U$ preserves fibrations.
    \item $F$ preserves cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations.
    \item $U$ preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations.
    \item $F$ preserves acyclic cofibrations and $U$ preserves acyclic cofibrations.
\end{enumerate}
The Quillen adjunction is a \emph{Quillen equivalence} if for any map $f\colon FX\to Y$ with adjoint $g\colon X\to UY$, where $X$ is cofibrant and $Y$ is fibrant, $f$ is a weak equivalence in $\cat N$ if and only if $g$ is a weak equivalence in $\cat M$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    If $(F, U)$ is a Quillen adjunction, then the total derived functors $\mathds LF\colon \Ho \cat M\to \Ho\cat N$ and $\mathds R U$ exist and form an adjoint pair. If $(F, U)$ is a Quillen equivalence, then $(\mathds LF,\mathds RU)$ is an adjoint equivalence between $\Ho\cat M$ and $\Ho\cat N$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
    If $F\colon \cat M\to \cat N$ is a left Quillen functor and $g\colon X\to Y$ is a map in $\cat M$, then the total left derived functor $\mathds F\colon\Ho\cat M\to\Ho\cat N$ takes the image of $g$ in $\Ho\cat M$ to the image in $\Ho\cat N$ of $F(\tilde g)$ for some cofibrant approximation $\tilde g\colon\tilde X\to\tilde Y$ of $g$.
\end{lemma}

% \begin{example}

% \end{example}

TODO: Reference or proof for the following.
\begin{theorem}
    If $(F, U)$ is a Quillen adjunction, then $F$ preserves homotopy pushouts: for any diagram $X\xfrom{f} A \xto{g} Y$, the natural map $F(X)\coprod^h_{F(A)} F(Y) \to F(X\coprod^h_A Y)$ is a weak equivalence. Dually, $U$ preserves homotopy pullbacks.
\end{theorem}

\section{Examples of Model Categories}
\subsection{Simplicial Sets}
\subsection{Spaces}
Let $\cat I$ be the set of inclusions $S^{n-1}\to D^n$ for $n\geq 0$, where $S^{-1}=\emptyset$. Let $\cat J$ be the set of inclusions $i_0\colon D^n\to D^n\times I$.
\begin{theorem}
There is a model structure, called the classical model or Quillen model structure structure on spaces, on the category of compactly generated topological spaces, in which
\begin{itemize}
    \item the weak equivalences are weak homotopy equivalences
    \item the fibrations are the Serre fibrations, i.e. maps which have the right lifting property with respect to $\cat J$
    \item cofibrations are the retracts of relative cell complexes
\end{itemize}
The acyclic fibrations are the maps which have the right lifting property with respect to $\cat I\union\cat J$. 

The classical model structure on topological spaces is proper, cofibrantly generated and a monoidal model category. 
\end{theorem}
See \cite[17.2.2]{may2011more}.

Every space is fibrant with respect to this model structure, the cofibrant spaces are retracts of generalized cell complexes.


\begin{theorem}
    There exists a model structure, called the Str√∏m model structure, on the category of compactly generated spaces, in which
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the weak equivalences are the homotopy equivalences
        \item fibrations are the Hurewicz fibrations, which are defined to be the maps that have the right lifting property with respect to all inclusions $A\injto A\times I$
        \item cofibrations are determined by these classes and are called the closed Hurewicz cofibrations.
    \end{itemize} 
    The Str√∏m model is proper and a monoidal model category. 
\end{theorem}
See \cite[17.1.1 and 17.1.3]{may2011more}.
The cofibrations of this model are the classical cofibrations, i.e.\ the maps that satisfy the left lifting property with respect to maps $B^I\xto{ev_0} B$ for all $B$. Similarly the fibrations satisfy the right lifting property with respect to the inclusions $A\xto{i_0} A\times I$ for all $A$. The Str√∏m model is not cofibrantly generated, see for example remark 4.7 in \cite{raptis2010homotopy}.

\subsection{Chain Complexes}
Let $R$ be a ring, $R-mod$ its category of modules and $\Ch_{\geq 0}(R-mod)$ the category of connective chain complexes (i.e.\ $0$ in negative degree).
\begin{theorem}[{\cite[II.4]{quillen2006homotopical}}, \cite{strickland2020model}]
    There is a model category structure called the \emph{projective model structure} on the category of chain complexes $\Ch_{\geq 0}(R-mod)$ whose
    \begin{itemize}
        \item weak equivalences are the quasi-isomorphisms
        \item fibrations are the morphisms that are underlying epimorphisms in $R-mod$ in each positive degree
        \item cofibrations are degreewise monomorphisms with degreewise projective cokernel. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    The projective model structure on $\Ch_{\geq 0}$ on connective chain complexes is proper. It is a monoidal model category with respect to the tensor product of chain complexes. It is cofibrantly generated with the generating cofibrations

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=10pt]
        S^{n-1} \ar[d, "{ i_n }"] \ar[r, phantom, ":"] &\big[\; \cdots & \ar[l] 0  \ar[d] & \ar[l] 0  \ar[d] & \ar[l] 0  \ar[d] & \ar[l] R  \ar[d, "{\mathrm{id}}"] & \ar[l] 0  \ar[d] & \ar[l] \cdots \;\big] \\
        D^n \ar[r, phantom, ":"] & \big[\; \cdots & \ar[l] 0  & \ar[l] 0 & \ar[l] \underset{ \mathclap{ \raisebox{-3pt}{ \scalebox{.7}{ $\mathrm{deg} = n$ } } } }{ R } &  \ar[l, "{ \mathrm{id} }"]R & 0 \ar[l] & \cdots \ar[l] \;\big] 
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

  and generating acyclic cofibrations
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=10pt]
        0 \ar[d, "{ j_n }"] \ar[r, phantom, ":"] & \big[\; \cdots & 0 \ar[l] \ar[d] & 0 \ar[l] \ar[d] & 0 \ar[l] \ar[d] & 0 \ar[l] \ar[d] & 0 \ar[l] \ar[d] & \ar[l]\cdots \;\big] \\
        D^n \ar[r, phantom, ":"] & \big[\; \cdots & 0 \ar[l] & 0 \ar[l] & \underset{ \mathclap{ \raisebox{-3pt}{ \scalebox{.7}{ $\mathrm{deg} = n$ } } } }{ R } \ar[l] & \ar[l, "{\mathrm{id}}"] R  & 0 \ar[l] & \ar[l] \cdots \;\big] 
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    \end{theorem}
For a proof of the properness and the cofibrant generation, see theorems 23, 24 \cite{strickland2020model}. TODO: Monoidal model category - check if this is needed.
% \begin{proof}
%     Properness means that the pushout of any weak equivalence along any cofibration is still a weak equivalence and that the pullback of any weak equivalence along any fibration is again a weak equivalence. We show the first part only, consider a pushout square
%     \begin{tikzcd}
%         A_* \dar\rar & B_*\dar \\
%         C_* \rar D_*
%     \end{tikzcd}

%     The claim that $\Ch_{\geq 0}$ is cofibrantly generated amounts to checking that a map of chain complexes is a an epimorphism if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to the maps $0\to D^n$ for all $n\geq 1$ and that it is an epimorphism and quasi-isomorphism if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to the maps $S^{n-1}\to D^n$. This is an easy diagram chase.

\bibliography{bibliography}

\end{document}






























\section{Loop Space}

Presentations of $S^1$ as a homotopy colimit usually induce presentations of the free loop space as as homotopy limit. 
\begin{align*}
S^1 &= \hocolim \{* \rightrightarrows *\} \\
\Lambda X &= \holim \{ X \rightrightarrows X\}
\end{align*}
Here the arrows are two copies of the identity map.

\begin{align*}
S^1 &= \hocolim \{* \coprod * \rightrightarrows * \} \\
\Lambda X &= \holim \{ X \rightrightarrows X \times X \} = X \times_{X\times X} X
\end{align*}
Here the arrows are two copies of the unique map resp.\ the diagonal map.

A computation of the first homotopy limit via the Bousfield-Kan approach / Reedy models leads to the following cosimplicial space

\begin{tikzcd}
    X \arrow[r, shift left=1]\arrow[r, shift right=1] & X \times X \rar[shift left = 2]\rar\rar[shift right=2] & X \times X \times X \rar[shift left=3]\rar[shift left=1]\rar[shift right=1]\rar[shift right=3] & X \times X \times X \times X \dots
\end{tikzcd}

The $i$-th boundary map $X^n\to X^{n+1}$ duplicates the $i$-th element into the $i$-th and ($i+1$)-th position modulo $n+1$. The degeneracy maps erase any except the first element.

The totalization $Tot(X_*)$ of a cosimplicial space $X_*$ is the space of natural transformations $Map(\Delta^*, X_*)$, where $\Delta^*$ is the standard cosimplicial space. Its topology is the subspace topology from the inclusion into $\Prod_n X_n^{\Delta^n}$.

If $X_*$ is the cosimplicial space associated to the loop space as above, then its totalization is indeed the loop space: one checks that the higher simplices are uniquely determined by the $1$-simplex through the degeneracy maps. 

Composing the cosimplicial object $X_*$ with the singular chain complex functor yields a cosimplicial chain complex whose totalization is quasi-isomorphic to the coHochschild chain complex. Dually, applying the singular cochain functor yields a simplicial chain complex whose realization is quasi-isomorphic to the Hochschild chain complex. Hence we are interested in how totalization and the chain complex functors commute. 

The result that we are looking for is that taking homotopy limits/colimits of topological spaces resp.\ chain complexes commutes with the chain complex functors. The classical way to do this is via Quillen adjunction, but we would like to see this done via $\infty$-categories. Afterwards we just have to check how the homotopy limit of chain complexes is computed. 

Patras-Thomas give a morphism 
\begin{align*} 
    \phi\colon \realization{NC(X^K)}^* \to C^*(\totalization{X^K}),
\end{align*}
where $NC$ is the normalized complex and bars are realization of a simplicial chain complex resp.\ totalization of a cosimplicial space. They show that under certain assumptions on connectedness this yields an isomorphism of cohomology algebras. The map $\phi$ is defined as follows: let $\underline{Z}$ be a cosimplicial space, then 
\begin{align*}
    \phi_{p,s}\colon C^{p+s}(\underline Z[p]) \xrightarrow{e_p^*} C^{p+s}(\Delta^p \times \totalization{\underline Z}) \xrightarrow{\int_{\Delta^p}} C^s(\totalization{\underline{Z}})
\end{align*}
Note that $e_p$ composes to a morphism of cosimplicial spaces $\underline{\Delta} \times \totalization{\underline{Z}} \to \underline Z$. The dual map is
\begin{align*}
    C_{p+s}(\underline Z[p]) \xleftarrow{e_p} C_{p+s}(\Delta^p \times \totalization{\underline Z}) \xleftarrow{\times \Delta^p} C_s(\totalization{\underline{Z}})
\end{align*}
This can also be seen as a map
\begin{align*}
    \phi_p\colon C_*(\totalization{\underline{Z}}) \xrightarrow{[\Delta^p] \times} C_{*+p}(\Delta^p \times \totalization{\underline Z}) \to C_{*+p}(\underline{Z}[p])
\end{align*}
This gives a total map 
\begin{align*}
    \phi &\colon C_{*}(\totalization{\underline{Z}}) \to \Prod_{p} C_{*+p}(\Delta^p \times \totalization{\underline Z}) \to \Prod_{p} C_{*+p}(\underline Z[p]) \\
    \phi &\colon C_{*}(\totalization{\underline{Z}}) \to \totalization{ C_{*}(\underline{\Delta} \times \totalization{\underline Z})} \to \totalization{C_{*}(\underline Z)} \\
\end{align*}
Setting $\underline Z = X^{S^1_*}$:
\begin{align*}
    C_*(\Lambda X) \to C_{*+p}(\Delta^p \times \Lambda X) \to C_{*+p}(X^{p+1})
\end{align*}
and one can check that the right map is indeed given by evaluation. 


\section{CoHochschild Construction and Base Points}

The usual cobar and coHochschild constructions are applied to $C \coloneqq C_*(X, x)$, the complex generated by singular simplicial maps with vertices mapped to a fixed $x\in X$. This seems sensible for the cobar construction, which models the based loop space, but for the free loop space, we would like to omit the choice of base point. 

Recall that the singular complex $C_*(X)$ is a coalgebra with two $C_0 \coloneqq C_0(X)$-coactions $\lambda \colon C\to C_0 \otimes C$ resp. $\rho\colon C\to C\otimes C_0$ from the left and the right, which extract the first resp. last last vertex of a singular simplex. Let $\tau\colon C_1 \otimes \dots \otimes C_k\to C_2 \otimes C_k \otimes C_1$ be the cyclic permutation map with the usual Koszul sign. There are $k$ pairs of parallel maps $C^{\otimes k} \to C \otimes C_0 \otimes C^{k-1}$ given by $(\rho \otimes id^{k-1})\tau^i$ resp. $(id\otimes \lambda\otimes id^{k-2}) \tau^i$. 
\begin{definition}
    The cyclic cotimes product $C^{\square k} \subset C^{\otimes k}$ is the collection of those elements such that each pair of coaction maps as defined above agrees. More generally, one can define a cyclic cotimes product of a tuple of bicoalgebras.
\end{definition}
This means that the sum of first vertices in the $i+1$-th factor agrees with the sum of last vertices in the $i$-th factor. 
Note that even in for $k=1$ this is generally a nontrivial condition and we have in particular defined $C^{\square 1} = C^\square\subset C$. 

This is not a complex using the differential on $C^{\otimes k}$, because the outer face maps $\partial_0$ and $\partial_k$ do not respect the imposed condition. One can obtain a complex by defining a differential which omits the outer face maps. 


\section{Spectra}
Let $Sp$ be the category of spectra. $Sp$ is closed monoidal with the smash product $\wedge$ and the sphere spectrum $\mathbb S$. There is a functor $\Sigma^\infty\colon Top_* \to Sp$ resp.  $\Sigma_+^\infty\colon Top \to Sp$ with an adjunction $\Sigma^\infty_+ \dashv \Omega^\infty$. The homology wrt a homology theory associated to a spectrum $E$ can be computed via 
\begin{align*}
    H_*(X, E) &= X \wedge E  &&H_n(X, E) = \pi_n(X \wedge E) = [\Sigma^n \mathbb S, X\wedge E] \\
    H^*(X, E) &= [X, E]  &&H^n(X, E) = \pi_n([X, E]) = [\Sigma^n \mathbb S\wedge X, E]
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Umkehr maps} Given an embedding of closed manifolds $P\subset N$ and a vector bundle $\xi$ on $N$, one can give an umkehr map $f_\xi^! \colon N^\xi \to P^{\nu + \xi}$ of Thom spectra, where $\nu$ is the normal bundle of $P$.
